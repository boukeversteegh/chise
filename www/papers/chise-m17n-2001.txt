What is 知世? (1)

    知 (Knowledge, Information)

    世 (world and age)

Not only for worldwide,
 but also for time (ancient → future)



What is 知世? (2)

・CHISE (CHaracter Information
		Service Environment)
	character information server

・TOMOYO (Text Object Manipulator
		and Outfit for YOurself)


History (1)— Before UTF-2000

・each character is
	represented by coded character sets



History (2) — UTF-2000 (1)

・each character is
	represented by character object



UTF-2000 (2)

・Every character related information
	are stored in character database

  - system gets property of character
	from the database

  - user can add characters by definition
	→ not only shape
	→ user can use own unification rule


XEmacs UTF-2000

・sample implementation of UTF-2000

	based on XEmacs-Mule



Problem of XEmacs UTF-2000

・Require too big memory
  → external database + lazy loading

・There are no UTF-2000 based
	external representations
  → XML? for file
     multipart/related
	+ application/char-info for MIME

→ 知世 project


Plan of 知世 (CHISE)

(1) private character database
	based on dbm like simple database

(2) local character database server
	(based on PostgreSQL?)

(3) distributed server system
	- How to sync
	- Check conflicts and report


Plan of 知世 (TOMOYO)

(0) Complete UTF-2000
    (a) complete XEmacs UTF-2000
		and send MEGA patch
		to xemacs-patches :-)
    (b) implement GNU Emacs 21 UTF-2000

(1) Multiple representation in one system

(2) Character definition editor

(3) Network representation


Related Plan

・Develop high quality character data
	not depended on any character codes

・Integrate glyph, shape and
	type setting information
	into the character database system

・Searchable image based document database
	(especially for classical
	 Chinese documents,
		such as 拓本, 稀覯本)
