            </h3>
            					
            					
            <p><a name="d0e85"></a>The Topic Map Standard 
                 ‘provides a standardized notation
               						for interchangeably representing information about the
               						structure of information resources used to define topics,
               						and the relationships between topics. ’
               A set of one or more
               						interrelated documents that employs the notation defined
               							by this International Standard is called a `topic map'. In
               						general, the structural information conveyed by topic maps
               							includes: 
               <ol>
                  <li><a name="d0e95"></a>groupings of addressable information objects
                     									around `topics' (`occurrences'), and 
                  </li>
                  <li><a name="d0e104"></a>relationships between
                     									topics (`associations'). 
                  </li>
               </ol>
               						
            </p>
            					
            <p><a name="d0e111"></a>A topic map defines a
               						multidimensional topic space — a space in which the
               						locations are topics, and in which the distances between
               						topics are measurable in terms of the number of
               						intervening topics which must be visited in order to get
               						from one topic to another, and the kinds of relationships
               						that define the path from one topic to another, if any,
               						through the intervening topics, if any. (from the document
               						defining Topic Maps as ISO/IEC 13250:2000)
            </p>
            					
            <p><a name="d0e114"></a>The standard as published in 2000 includes a
               						serialization format specification in form of a Document
               						Type Definition (DTD) originally using HyTime (ISO/IEC
               						10744:1992) Architectural Forms and a SGML (ISO/IEC
               						8879:1986) based syntax.  An independent group of vendors
               						started development of a XML based version, which was
               						published as XTM 1.0 in December 2000 and per ballot
               						adopted as an amendment to the ISO standard in December
               						2001.  The development here is based on the XML syntax,
               						which has also quite different elements and structure.
            </p>
            					
            <p><a name="d0e117"></a>Since SGML/XML based formats are overly verbose
               						(especially XTM 1.0) and awkward to work with, other
               						formats have been suggested, including the `Asymptotic Topic Map Notation, Authoring'
               						(AsTMA, by Robert Barta) and `Linear Topic Map
               						Notation' (LTM, by Lars Marius Garshol). Both
               						are essentially line
               						based and can be easily edited in UTF-2000 and other
               						editors.
            </p>
            					
            <p><a name="d0e126"></a>Besides defining a serialization format for the exchange of
               						information, the Topic Map standard also includes
               						constructs that are intended to faciliate exchange of
               						information.  One of the most important tasks is to
               						reliably identify identical pieces of information across
               						different sources.  Towards this end, rules for subsetting
               						and merging of topic maps are laid down in the standard.
               						Topics can be defined with reference to Published Subject
               						Indicators (PSI), which function in a similar way to XML
               						Namespaces.

            <p><a name="d0e137"></a>Characters are used in scripts for the writing of
               						languages, languages are distributed in different areas.
               						The exact form of these characters, as well as their
               						phonetic representation changes over time and area.  The
               						adaption of the Topic Map paradigm in a character database
               					tries to use these different axes to organise them in a way
               						that is appropriate to the domain they are encountered
               						in.  Characters are thus not only objects in their own
               						right, but these objects are organized in a hierarchy of
               						`super-class / sub-class' and
               						`class / instance' hierarchies.

                  							Python classes.  In a first implementation, ZClasses
                  						have been used. 
               </p>
               						
               <p><a name="d0e312"></a>In this implementation, four classes have been used to
                  							represent the different objects of a Topic Map:
                  <ul>
                     <li><a name="d0e316"></a>topicmap:  The container item for all the other classes
                     </li>
                     <li><a name="d0e319"></a>topic:  Container item for occurrences
                     </li>
                     <li><a name="d0e322"></a>occurrence:  Holds the key / value pairs of occurrences
                     </li>
                     <li><a name="d0e325"></a>association: Information about the type, role
                        						and value of the members is hold in instance attributes
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  						This data structure was closely modelled on the underlying
                  						data structure of the Topic Map serialization format, as
                  						realized in the XTM 1.0 DTD.  The built-in Zope search
                  						engine ZCatalog was used to built indices and access the
                  							different information axes.  <a class="ptr" href="#zope-man">Figure 7</a>

               <p><a name="d0e344"></a>This approach turned out to induce a large overhead for
                  						the data and proved problematic for Topic Maps with more
                  						than approximately 1000 topics and associations.  For this
                  						reasons, this approach has been given up.
               </p>
               						
               <p><a name="d0e347"></a>The next logical step was to use a native Python
                  						Product, insted of the ZClasses.  This should give better
                  						performance, since less overhead is involved, it also
                  						allows greater flexibility in the data structures. An
                  						additional advantage is that a more efficient development
                  						environment could be used due to the fact that the source
                  						is on the file system and not in the Zope database.
               </p>
               						
               <p><a name="d0e350"></a>Performance was slightly improved, but not as much as
                  						hoped for.   It also turned out that some flaws in the
                  						data structure defined for the Python classes did not
                  						allow the full expressive power that was required for
                  						Topic Maps in XTM 1.0.  
               </p>
               						
               <p><a name="d0e353"></a>Around this time, development activity started once
                  						again in the Zope ParsedXML product, which is the Zope
                  						product that provides XML functionality.  Since an XML
                  						Document Object Model (DOM) tree shares some similiarity
                  						to the Zope DOM (ZDOM) used to store the Zope objects, it
                  						was expected that this approach might scale better.  An
                  						additional advantage was that Zope procedures could be
                  						used to directly expose XML elements in DTML (Document
                  						Template Markup Language).  For this reason, it was
                  						decided to start once again, this time with ZClasses using
                  						the ParsedXML product. 
               </p>
               						
               <p><a name="d0e356"></a>Development of this prototype had progressed quite some
                  						while, when it was realized that the support for Unicode
                  						in Zope, which was introduced in Zope 2.4.0 had some
                  						flaws.  While UTF-8 could be used with out problems in
                  						previous versions, the partial support for Unicode meant
                  						that Python UnicodeStrings in some cases could be cast as
                  						AsciiStrings, which would crash the process.  While some
                  						patches became available and development of the Zope core
                  						continued to adress this problem, it remained acute even
                  						with the recent 2.5.0 release and will probably only
                  						resolved in the upcoming Zope 3.0 release, which will be a
                  						major rewrite.
               </p>
               						
               <p><a name="d0e359"></a>While the improvement of the support for Unicode within
                  						Zope is important, it remains outside of the scope and
                  						timeframe of this project.  As a temporary fix therefore,
                  						no Unicode characters can be used in the TopicMap engine.
                  						While this is unfortunate, since the XML standard
                  						explicitly requires conformant XML processors to support
                  						at least UTF-8 and UTF-16, there is nothing that can be
                  						done about this at the moment, this situation will improve
                  						with the arrival of a fully Unicode compliant version of
                  						Zope.

               <p><a name="d0e574"></a>The goal of developping a complete Topic Map engine
                  						based on Zope has not been reached.  This has been partly
                  						due to the development process, which had to confront some
                  						fundamental issues of processing Topic Maps, which had not
                  						been solved so far.  While the goal of developing a
                  						generic Topic Map engine is worthwhile and important, it
                  						proved to be too ambitious for the context of this
                  						project.  We therefore had to settle to a solution that
                  						works well for this context and are confident that it will
                  						be possible to generalize from there.
               </p>
               						
               <p><a name="d0e577"></a>It has also been realized that Zope is maybe not a
                  						suitable platform for holding the potentially very large
                  						data of a Topic Map.  Using a database for this approach
                  						would be better.

            <p><a name="d0e587"></a>The current model of implementing the Topic Map engine
               					and interfacing it with XEmacs UTF-2000 is 
               					based on a two way connection.  
            </p>
            					
            <p><a name="d0e590"></a>Storing the Topic Map in the Zope object database proved
               					to be a performance bottleneck.  The logical way to solve
               					this problem is to move the data to an external storage.  To
               					test the feasability of this approach, the Topic Map
               					datastructure has been mapped to a set of relational
               					database tables and a Topic Map has been imported into the database
               					Postgresql.  
            </p>
            					
            <p><a name="d0e593"></a>The connection between XEmacs UTF-2000, the
               					Topic Map engine within Zope and the storage backend can now
               						be established in a triangular way as shown in <a class="ptr" href="#pg-u2k-zope">Figure 12</a>.  The red arrows symbolize updates to
               					the database, while the green arrows stand for data that are
               					retrieved from the databases.  Both, XEmacs UTF-2000 and the
               					Zope Topic Map engine will be able to commit updates and
               					retrieve data.  While the model employed so far
               					assumed a direct communication between XEmacs UTF-2000 and
               					the Zope Topic Map engine, this model provides a far more
               					flexible way of communication by introducing another layer
               					between them.  This model is also extendible, since more
               					partners can be connected to the database through a set of
               					well defined interfaces and a cascade of such layers can be
               					built in a distributed way.

               						While time did not permit to properly change the backend
               						of the Topic Map engine,
               						this will be a straightforward task that is not expected to
               						require changes to the other layers of the program.
