This document describes how to install Omega/CHISE, which can produce
PDF from the text written by XEmacs/CHISE. After finishing the
installation, you will be able to convert test.tex in this directory.

  * Omega/CHISE requires perl 5.8.1 or higher;
    the old perl script, inCHISE-5.6, is obsolete.
