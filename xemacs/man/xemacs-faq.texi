 *****************************************
 ***** To update the menus and nodes *****
 *****************************************

First, the first argument to @node (the name itself) needs to be correct.
Use a macro if necessary to update the @node names from the
@unnumberedsubsec commands.  Also note that the command we're about to
run will not correctly fix up the part of the menu to the right of a ::.
It will leave existing text in place but not change anything.  If you
make a lot of changes and want to update this semi-automatically, use
M-x occur to pick out all @unnumberedsubsec lines then do some editing
magic to coerce them into the right format and cut and paste as necessary:

1. M-x occur @unnumberedsubsec
2. <select a rectangle including all text before the Q#.#.#>
3. C-x r t *<space>
4. go to the top and use the following macro to get the indentation right.
 
(setq last-kbd-macro (read-kbd-macro
"C-s : RET : <right> M-x indent- to- column RET 14 RET <home> <down>"))

5. Cut and paste the menus into the detailmenu at the top and
   individual menus at the top of the appropriate chapters. (#### I
   wonder, does texinfo-master-menu generate the detailmenu from the
   individual menus or vice-versa or neither?)

Then,

6. C-u C-c C-u m (C-u M-x texinfo-master-menu) will update the menus
   and nodes.  However, it appears that even though it tries to
   preserve the existing menu structure as much as possible, it
   doesn't do a perfect job.  It messes up in at least two ways: The
   indentation in the part of the main menu above the detailmenu will
   be screwed up, and the #.0 titles will be removed from both the
   detailmenu and the individual chapter menus.  In addition,
   sometimes random things get screwed up in individual parts of the
   menus.  Therefore:

   1. Use the Lisp line below to get the spacing correct for the Q#.#.#
   menu entries.

(set (make-local-variable 'texinfo-column-for-description) 14)

   2. Copy the whole detailmenu beforehand.
   3. Run C-u C-c C-u m to fix up the nodes.
   4. Run `fix-main-menu' and `fix-omitted-menu-lines'.
   5. Check the new detailmenu carefully to see if anything is screwed up
      compared to the old detailmenu you copied.
   6. If so, paste back the appropriate sections and fix up the corresponding
      part of the chapter-specific menu.

(defun fix-main-menu ()
  (interactive)
  (save-restriction
    (let (p q)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (re-search-forward "^@menu")
      (setq p (match-beginning 0))
      (re-search-forward "^$")
      (setq q (match-end 0))
      (narrow-to-region p q)
      (goto-char p)
      (while (search-forward "::  " nil t)
        (indent-to-column 26)))))

(defun fix-omitted-menu-lines ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (loop for x from 1 to 10 do
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (re-search-forward (format "@unnumberedsec \\(%d.0: .*\\)" x))
      (let ((line (match-string 1)))
	(re-search-backward "^@menu")
	(forward-line 1)
	(unless (looking-at "[0-9]+.0:")
	  (insert line)
	  (insert "\n"))
	(goto-char (point-min))
	(re-search-forward "^@menu")
	(search-forward (format "Q%d.0.1:" x))
	(forward-line -1)
	(unless (looking-at "[0-9]+.0:")
	  (insert "\n")
	  (insert line))))))

 *****************************************
 *****            Other work         *****
 *****************************************

When you've rearranged and renumbered a bunch of nodes, you can get
the numbers agreeing again.  The macro below assumes that the
unnumberedsubsec number is correct, and fixes up the node to agree.
Only the first part of the node is fixed and the other parts may still
be wrong; but they will be fixed as part of
@code{texinfo-master-menu}.

(setq last-kbd-macro (read-kbd-macro
"<f1> unnumberedsubsec SPC RET C-s : RET <left> C-x C-x <f3> <home> <up> <C-right> <right> C-s , RET <left> C-x C-x <f4> <home> 2*<down>"))

@unnumbered 1 Introduction, Policy, Credits

Learning XEmacs is a lifelong activity.  Even people who have used Emacs
for years keep discovering new features.  Therefore this document cannot
be complete.  Instead it is aimed at the person who is either
considering XEmacs for their own use, or has just obtained it and is
wondering what to do next.  It is also useful as a reference to
available resources.

The previous maintainer of the FAQ was
@email{rossini@@biostat.washington.edu, Anthony Rossini}, who started
it, after getting tired of hearing JWZ complain about repeatedly
having to answer questions.  @email{ben@@xemacs.org, Ben Wing} then
took over and did a massive update reorganizing the whole thing.  At
this point Anthony took back over, but then had to give it up again.
Some of the other contributors to this FAQ are listed later in this
document.

The previous version was converted to hypertext format, and edited by
@email{steve@@xemacs.org, Steven L. Baur}.  It was converted back to
texinfo by @email{hniksic@@xemacs.org, Hrvoje Niksic}.  The FAQ was then
maintained by @email{andreas@@sccon.com, Andreas Kaempf}, who passed it
on to ChristianNyb@o{}, and then to @email{wambold@@xemacs.org,Sandra Wambold}.

The current version of the FAQ has been heavily redone by
@email{ben@@xemacs.org, Ben Wing}.

If you notice any errors or items which should be added or amended to
this FAQ please send email to @email{xemacs-beta@@xemacs.org}.
Include @samp{XEmacs FAQ} on the Subject: line.

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.0.1: What is XEmacs?

XEmacs is a powerful, highly customizable open source text editor and
application development system, with full GUI support.  It is
protected under the GNU Public License and related to other versions
of Emacs, in particular GNU Emacs.  Its emphasis is on modern
graphical user interface support and an open software development
model, similar to Linux.  XEmacs has an active development community
numbering in the hundreds (and thousands of active beta testers on top
of this), and runs on all versions of MS Windows, on Mac OS X, on
Linux, and on nearly every other version of Unix in existence.
Support for XEmacs has been supplied by Sun Microsystems, University
of Illinois, Lucid, ETL/Electrotechnical Laboratory, Amdahl
Corporation, BeOpen, and others, as well as the unpaid time of a great
number of individual developers.

@node Q1.0.2, Q1.0.3, Q1.0.1, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.0.2: What is the current version of XEmacs?

XEmacs versions 21.4.* are releases made from the current stable
sources.  XEmacs versions 21.5.* (which will be released as 22.0) are
releases made from the development sources.  Check at
@uref{http://www.xemacs.org} for the current minor version.  XEmacs
versions 21.1.* were the previous stable releases, now retired.

XEmacs 20.4, released in February 1998, was the last release of v20.

XEmacs 19.16, released in November, 1997. was the last release of v19,
and was also the last version without international language support.

@node Q1.0.3, Q1.0.4, Q1.0.2, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.0.3: How do you pronounce XEmacs?

The most common pronounciation is @samp{Eks eemax}.

@node Q1.0.4, Q1.0.5, Q1.0.3, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.0.4: What does XEmacs look like?

Screen snapshots are available at

as part of the XEmacs website.

@node Q1.0.5, Q1.0.6, Q1.0.4, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.0.5: Who wrote XEmacs?

XEmacs is the result of the time and effort of many people, and the
active developers have changed over time.  There are two major
components of the XEmacs effort -- writing the code itself and providing
all the support work (testing the code, releasing beta and final
versions, handling patches, reading bug reports, maintaining the web
site, managing the mailing lists, etc. etc.).  Neither component would
work without the other.

@subheading CODING

The primary code contributor over the years has been Ben Wing (active
since late 1992).  Between 1991 and 1995, large amounts of coding was
contributed by Jamie Zawinski and Chuck Thompson.  Many other people
have authored major subsystems or otherwise contributed large amounts of
code, including Andy Piper, Hrvoje Niksic, Jerry James, Jonathan Harris,
Kyle Jones, Martin Buchholz, Michael Sperber, Olivier Galibert, Richard
Mlynarik, Stig, William Perry and plenty of others.

@unnumberedsec 1.1: Getting XEmacs

@node Q1.1.1, Q1.1.2, Q1.0.6, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.1.1: Where can I find XEmacs?

To download XEmacs, visit the XEmacs WWW page at
@uref{http://www.xemacs.org/Download/}.  The most up-to-date list of
distribution sites can always be found there.  Try to pick a site that
is networkologically close to you.  If you know of other mirrors of
the XEmacs archives, please send e-mail to
@uref{mailto:webmaster@@xemacs.org} and we will list them here as well.

The canonical distribution point is ftp.xemacs.org, available either
through HTTP (@uref{http://ftp.xemacs.org/}) or anonymous FTP
(@uref{ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/}).

@node Q1.1.2, Q1.1.3, Q1.1.1, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.1.2: Are binaries available?

MS Windows binaries are available at
@uref{http://www.xemacs.org/Download/win32/} for the native versions
of 21.4 and 21.1.  Cygwin binaries are now available as part of the
standard Cygwin installation process.  XEmacs also comes pre-built as
part of many Linux distributions, such as Red Hat and SuSE.

Otherwise, you will need to build XEmacs yourself or get your system
administrator to do it.  Generally, this is not a difficult process
under Unix and Mac OS X, as XEmacs has been tested under all of the
common Unix versions and under Mac OS X and comes with an extensive
configure script that is able to automatically detect most aspects of
the configuration of your particular system.

@node Q1.1.3, Q1.1.4, Q1.1.2, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.1.3: How do I get the bleeding-edge sources?

If you are interested in developing XEmacs, or getting the absolutely most
recent, up-to-the-moment, bleeding-edge source code, you can directly
access the master CVS source tree (read-only, of course, until you ask for
and are granted permission to directly modify portions of the source tree)
at cvs.xemacs.org.  Directions on how to access the source tree are located
at @uref{http://www.xemacs.org/Develop/cvsaccess.html}.

Nightly CVS snapshots are available at
@uref{http://www.dk.xemacs.org/Download/CVS-snapshots/}.

@node Q1.1.4, Q1.2.1, Q1.1.3, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.1.4: Where can I obtain a printed copy of the XEmacs User's Manual?

Pre-printed manuals are not available.  If you are familiar with
TeX, you can generate your own manual from the XEmacs sources.

HTML and Postscript versions of XEmacs manuals are available from the
XEmacs web site at
@uref{http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/index.html}.

@unnumberedsec 1.2: Versions for Different Operating Systems

@node Q1.2.1, Q1.2.2, Q1.1.4, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.2.1: Do I need X11 to run XEmacs?

No.  The name @dfn{XEmacs} is unfortunate in the sense that it is
@strong{not} an X Window System-only version of Emacs.  XEmacs has
full color support on a color-capable character terminal.

@node Q1.2.2, Q1.2.3, Q1.2.1, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.2.2: What versions of Unix does XEmacs run on?

XEmacs is regularly tested on Linux, Solaris, SunOS, HP/UX, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, BSD/OS aka BSDI, Tru64 aka DEC/OSF, SCO5, and probably
others.  It should work on all versions of Unix created in the last 10
years or so, perhaps with a bit of work on more obscure platforms to
correct bit-rot.  It uses a sophisticated configuration system to
auto-detect zillions of features that are implemented differently in
different versions of Unix, so it will probably work on your vendor's
version, possibly with a bit of tweaking, even if we've never heard of
it.

For problems with particular machines and versions of Unix, see the
@file{PROBLEMS} file.

Much effort has gone into making XEmacs work on as many different
machines, configurations, and compilers as possible.

Much effort has gone into making XEmacs 64-bit clean.

Much effort has gone into removing system-specific code, and replacing
such code with autodetection at configure time.

The XEmacs core should build "out of the box" on most Unix-like systems.

XEmacs 21.2 was tested and @samp{make check} succeeded on these Unix
configurations as of 2001-02-10:

@example
alphaev56-dec-osf4.0e (both Compaq C and gcc)
i386-unknown-freebsd4.2
i386-unknown-netbsdelf1.5
i586-sco-sysv5uw7.0.1 (both SCO's cc and gcc)
i686-pc-linux-gnu
hppa2.0-hp-hpux10.20 (both HP's ANSI cc and gcc)
mips-sgi-irix6.5 (both MIPSpro cc and gcc)
rs6000-ibm-aix4.3.0.0 (both IBM's xlc and gcc)
sparc-sun-solaris2.6 (both Sun's Forte C and gcc)
sparc-sun-solaris2.7 (both Sun's Forte C and gcc)
sparc-sun-sunos4.1.4 (gcc)
@end example

Some systems have a dual mode 32-bit/64-bit compiler.  On most of these,
XEmacs requires the @samp{--pdump} (in XEmacs 21.5,
@samp{--enable-pdump}) configure option to build correctly with the
64-bit version of the compiler.

@example
mips-sgi-irix6.5, CC="gcc -mabi=64"
mips-sgi-irix6.5, CC="cc -64"
rs6000-ibm-aix4.3.0.0, CC="cc -q64"
@end example

On most of these systems, XEmacs also builds with a C++ compiler,
but not "out of the box".  This feature is only for use by the
maintainers.

XEmacs 21.2 is known @emph{not} to work on any machines with m680x0
processors.  Sorry, all you sun3 and Unix PC nostalgia buffs out there.

VMS has never been supported by XEmacs.  In fact, all the old VMS code

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.2.3: Is there a port of XEmacs to Microsoft Windows?

Yes.  Beginning with release 21.0, XEmacs has worked under MS Windows
and is fully-featured and actively developed.  A group of dedicated
developers actively maintains and improves the Windows-specific
portions of the code.  Some of the core developers, in fact, use
Windows as their only development environment, and some features, such
as printing, actually work better on Windows than native Unix and Mac
OS X.  The mailing list at @email{xemacs-winnt@@xemacs.org} is dedicated
to that effort (please use the -request address to
subscribe). (Despite its name, XEmacs actually works on all versions
of Windows.)

The list name is misleading, as XEmacs supports and has been compiled on
Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows
XP, and all newer versions of Windows.  The MS Windows-specific code is
based on Microsoft Win32 API, and will not work on MS Windows 3.x or on
MS-DOS.

XEmacs also supports the Cygwin and MinGW development and runtime
environments, where it also uses native Windows code for graphical
features.  In addition, under Cygwin it is possible to compile XEmacs
to use an X server (and XFree86 is available as part of the standard
Cygwin installation).

@node Q1.2.4, Q1.2.5, Q1.2.3, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.2.4: Can I build XEmacs on MS Windows with X support?  Do I need to?

Yes, you can, but no you do not need to.  In fact, we recommend that you
use a native-GUI version unless you have a specific need for an X
version.

@node Q1.2.5, Q1.2.6, Q1.2.4, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.2.5: What are Cygwin and MinGW, and do I need them to run XEmacs?

To answer the second part of the question: No, you, you don't need
Cygwin or MinGW to build or to run XEmacs.  But if you have them and
want to use them, XEmacs supports these environments.

(One important reason to support Cygwin is that it lets the MS Windows
developers test out their code in a Unix environment without actually
having to have a Unix machine around.  For this reason alone, Cygwin
support is likely to remain supported for a long time in XEmacs.  Same
goes for the X support under Cygwin, for the same reasons.  MinGW
support, on the other hand, depends on volunteers to keep it up to date;
but this is generally not hard.)

Cygwin is a set of tools providing Unix-like API on top of Win32.
It makes it easy to port large Unix programs without significant
changes to their source code.  It is a development environment as well
as a runtime environment.

When built with Cygwin, XEmacs supports all display types -- TTY, X &
Win32 GUI, and can be built with support for all three simultaneously.
If you build with Win32 GUI support then the Cygwin version uses the
majority of the Windows-specific code, which is mostly related to
display.  If you want to build with X support you need X libraries (and
an X server to display XEmacs on); see @ref{Q2.3.7}.  TTY and Win32 GUI
require no additional libraries beyond what comes standard with Cygwin.

The advantages of the Cygwin version are that it integrates well with
the Cygwin environment for existing Cygwin users; uses configure so
building with different features is very easy; and actively supports X &
TTY.  Furthermore, the entire Cygwin environment and compiler are free,
whereas Visual C++ costs money.

The disadvantage is that it requires the whole Cygwin environment,
whereas the native port requires only a suitable MS Windows compiler.
Also, it follows the Unix filesystem and process model very closely
(some will undoubtedly view this as an advantage).

See @uref{http://www.cygwin.com/} for more information on
Cygwin.

MinGW is a collection of header files and import libraries that allow
one to use GCC under the Cygwin environment to compile and produce
exactly the same native Win32 programs that you can using Visual C++.
Programs compiled with MinGW make use of the standard Microsoft runtime
library @file{MSVCRT.DLL}, present on all Windows systems, and look,
feel, and act like a standard Visual-C-produced application. (The only
difference is the compiler.) This means that, unlike a
standardly-compiled Cygwin application, no extra runtime support
(e.g. Cygwin's @file{cygwin1.dll}) is required.  This, along with the
fact that GCC is free (and works in a nice Unix-y way in a nice Unix-y
environment, for those die-hard Unix hackers out there), is the main
advantage of MinGW.  It is also potentially faster than Cygwin because
it has less overhead when calling Windows, but you lose the POSIX
emulation layer, which makes Unix programs harder to port. (But this is
irrelevant for XEmacs since it's already ported to Win32.)

See @uref{http://www.mingw.org/} for more information on MinGW.

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.2.6: What are the differences between the various MS Windows emacsen?

XEmacs, Win-Emacs, DOS Emacs, NT Emacs, this is all very confusing.
Could you briefly explain the differences between them?

Here is a recount of various Emacs versions running on MS Windows:

@itemize @bullet

@item
XEmacs

@itemize @minus

@item
Beginning with XEmacs 19.12, XEmacs' architecture was redesigned
in such a way to allow clean support of multiple window systems.  At
this time the TTY support was added, making X and TTY the first two
"window systems" supported by XEmacs.  The 19.12 design is the basis for
the current native MS Windows code.

@item
Some time during 1997, David Hobley (soon joined by Marc Paquette)
imported some of the NT-specific portions of GNU Emacs, making XEmacs
with X support compile under Windows NT, and creating the "X" port.

@item
Several months later, Jonathan Harris sent out initial patches to use
the Win32 API, thus creating the native port.  Since then, various
people have contributed, including Kirill M. Katsnelson (contributed
support for menubars, subprocesses and network, as well as loads of
other code), Andy Piper (ported XEmacs to Cygwin environment,
contributed Windows unexec, Windows-specific glyphs and toolbars code,
and more), Ben Wing (loads of improvements; primary MS Windows developer
since 2000), Jeff Sparkes (contributed scrollbars support) and many
others.
@end itemize

@item
NT Emacs

@itemize @minus

@item
NT Emacs was an early version of GNU Emacs 19 modified to compile and
run under MS Windows 95 and NT using the native Win32 API.  It was
written by Geoff Voelker, and has long since been incorporated into
the mainline GNU Emacs distribution.
@end itemize

@item
Win-Emacs

@itemize @minus

@item
Win-Emacs was a port of Lucid Emacs 19.6 to MS Windows using X
compatibility libraries.  Win-Emacs was written by Ben Wing.  The MS
Windows code never made it back to Lucid Emacs, and its creator (Pearl
Software) has long since gone out of business.
@end itemize

@item
GNU Emacs for DOS

@itemize @minus

@item
GNU Emacs features support for MS-DOS and DJGPP (D.J. Delorie's DOS
port of GCC).  Such an Emacs is heavily underfeatured, because it does
not support long file names, lacks proper subprocesses support, and
is far too big compared with typical DOS editors.
@end itemize

@item
GNU Emacs compiled with Win32

@itemize @minus

@item
Starting with GNU Emacs 19.30, it has been possible to compile GNU Emacs
under MS Windows using the DJGPP compiler and X libraries.  The result
is very similar to GNU Emacs compiled under MS DOS, only it works
somewhat better because it runs in 32-bit mode, makes use of all the
system memory, supports long file names, etc.

@node Q1.2.7, Q1.2.8, Q1.2.6, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.2.7: How does the port cope with differences in the Windows user interface?

The XEmacs (and Emacs in general) user interface is pretty different
from what is expected of a typical MS Windows program.  How does the MS
Windows port cope with it?

As a general rule, we follow native MS Windows conventions as much as
possible.  21.4 is a fairly complete Windows application, supporting
native printing, system file dialog boxes, tool tips, etc.  In cases
where there's a clear UI conflict, we currently use normal Unix XEmacs
behavior by default, but make sure the MS Windows "look and feel" (mark
via shift-arrow, self-inserting deletes region, Alt selects menu items,
etc.) is easily configurable (respectively: using the variable
@code{shifted-motion-keys-select-region} in 21.4 and above [it's in fact
the default in these versions], or the @file{pc-select} package; using
the @file{pending-del} package; and setting the variable
@code{menu-accelerator-enabled} to @code{menu-force} in 21.4 and above).
In fact, if you use the sample @file{init.el} file as your init file,
you will get all these behaviors automatically turned on.

In future versions, some of these features might be turned on by
default in the MS Windows environment.

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.2.8: Is there a port of XEmacs to the Macintosh?

Yes.

XEmacs 21.5 (perhaps 21.4 also?) works on MacOS X, although it certainly
will not feel very much like a Mac application as it has no Mac-specific
code in it.

There is also a port of XEmacs 19.14 that works on all recent versions
of MacOS, from 8.1 through MacOS X, by @email{pjarvis@@ispchannel.com,
Pitts Jarvis} (recently deceased).  It runs in an equivalent of TTY

@node Q1.2.9, Q1.2.10, Q1.2.8, Introduction

No.  We have never supported running on MS-DOS or Windows 3.1, and in
fact have long since deleted all MS-DOS-related code.  We're not
particularly interested in patches for these platforms, as they would
introduce huge amounts of code clutter due to the woefully

MS-DOS.)

@unnumberedsec 1.3: Getting Started

@node Q1.3.1, Q1.3.2, Q1.2.12, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.1: What is an @file{init.el} or @file{.emacs} and is there a sample one?

The @file{init.el} or @file{.emacs} file is used to customize XEmacs to
your tastes.  Starting in 21.4, the preferred location for the init file
is @file{~/.xemacs/init.el}; in previous versions, it was
@file{~/.emacs}.  21.4 still accepts the old location, but the first
time you run it, it will ask to migrate your file to the new location.
If you answer yes, the file will be moved, and a "compatibility"
@file{.emacs} file will be placed in the old location so that you can
still run older versions of XEmacs, and versions of GNU Emacs, which
expect the old location.  The @file{.emacs} file present is just a stub
that loads the real file in @file{~/.xemacs/init.el}.

No two init files are alike, nor are they expected to be alike, but
that's the point.  The XEmacs distribution contains an excellent starter
example in the @file{etc/} directory called @file{sample.init.el}
(starting in 21.4) or @file{sample.emacs} in older versions.  Copy this
file from there to @file{~/.xemacs/init.el} (starting in 21.4) or
@file{~/.emacs} in older versions, where @samp{~} means your home
directory, of course.  Then edit it to suit.

You may bring the @file{sample.init.el} or @file{sample.emacs} file into
an XEmacs buffer from the menubar. (The menu entry for it is always
under the @samp{Help} menu, but its location under that has changed in
various versions.  Recently, look under the @samp{Samples} submenu.)  To
determine the location of the @file{etc/} directory type the command
@kbd{C-h v data-directory @key{RET}}.

@node Q1.3.2, Q1.3.3, Q1.3.1, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.2: Where do I put my @file{init.el} file?

@file{init.el} is the name of the init file starting with 21.4, and is
located in the subdirectory @file{.xemacs/} of your home directory.  In
prior versions, the init file is called @file{.emacs} and is located in
your home directory.

Your home directory under Windows is determined by the @samp{HOME}
environment variable.  If this is not set, it defaults to @samp{C:\}.
To set this variable, modify @file{AUTOEXEC.BAT} under Windows 95/98, or
select @samp{Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment Variables...}
under Windows NT/2000.

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.5: May I see an example of a useful XEmacs Lisp function?

The following function does a little bit of everything useful.  It does
something with the prefix argument, it examines the text around the
cursor, and it's interactive so it may be bound to a key.  It inserts
copies of the current word the cursor is sitting on at the cursor.  If
you give it a prefix argument: @kbd{C-u 3 M-x double-word} then it will
insert 3 copies.

@lisp
(defun double-word (count)
  "Insert a copy of the current word underneath the cursor"
  (interactive "*p")
  (let (here there string)
    (save-excursion
      (forward-word -1)
      (setq here (point))
      (forward-word 1)
      (setq there (point))
      (setq string (buffer-substring here there)))
    (while (>= count 1)
      (insert string)
      (decf count))))
@end lisp

The best way to see what is going on here is to let XEmacs tell you.
Put the code into an XEmacs buffer, and do a @kbd{C-h f} with the cursor
sitting just to the right of the function you want explained.  Eg.  move
the cursor to the SPACE between @code{interactive} and @samp{"*p"} and
hit @kbd{C-h f} to see what the function @code{interactive} does.  Doing
this will tell you that the @code{*} requires a writable buffer, and
@code{p} converts the prefix argument to a number, and
@code{interactive} allows you to execute the command with @kbd{M-x}.

@node Q1.3.6, Q1.3.7, Q1.3.5, Introduction

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.7: What's the difference between a macro and a function?

Quoting from the Lisp Reference (a.k.a @dfn{Lispref}) Manual:

@dfn{Macros} enable you to define new control constructs and other
language features.  A macro is defined much like a function, but instead
of telling how to compute a value, it tells how to compute another Lisp
expression which will in turn compute the value.  We call this
expression the @dfn{expansion} of the macro.

Macros can do this because they operate on the unevaluated expressions
for the arguments, not on the argument values as functions do.  They can
therefore construct an expansion containing these argument expressions
or parts of them.

Do not confuse the two terms with @dfn{keyboard macros}, which are
another matter, entirely.  A keyboard macro is a key bound to several
other keys.  Refer to manual for details.

@kbd{M-x customize}, @kbd{M-x customize-face},

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.5.3: How do I contribute to XEmacs itself?

It depends on the knowledge and time you possess.  If you are able, by
all means become a beta tester (@pxref{Q1.5.2}).  If you are a
programmer, try to build XEmacs and see if you can improve it.

Otherwise, you can still help by using XEmacs as your everyday editor
(for pre-built binary versions, @pxref{Q1.1.2}) and reporting bugs you
find to the mailing list.

Another area where we need help is the documentation: We need good
documentation for building XEmacs and for using it.  This FAQ is a
small step in that direction.

@node Q1.5.4, Q1.5.5, Q1.5.3, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.5.4: How do I get started developing XEmacs?

First, get yourself set up under CVS so that you can access the CVS
repositories containing the XEmacs sources and the XEmacs packages.

Next, set up your layout.  This is important, as a good layout will
facilitate getting things done efficiently, while a bad layout will could
lead to disaster, as you can't figure out which code is the most recent,
which can be thrown away, etc.  We suggest the following layout: (feel free
to make changes)

@itemize @bullet
@item
Everything goes under @file{/src/xemacs} (use a different directory if
you want).  From now, instead of saying @file{/src/xemacs}, we use
@file{<xsrc-top>}, to make it easier in case someone picked a
different directory.

@item
Package source is in @file{<xsrc-top>/package-src}.

@item
Installed packages go under @file{<xsrc-top>/xemacs-packages}, and
@file{<xsrc-top>/mule-packages}.

@item
A "workspace" is a complete copy of the sources, in which you do work of
a particular kind.  Workspaces can be differentiated by which branch of
the source tree they extend off of -- usually either the stable or
experimental, unless other branches have been created (for example, Ben
created a branch for his Mule work because (1) the project was long-term
and involved an enormous number of changes, (2) people wanted to be able
to look at what his work in progress, and (3) he wanted to be able to
check things in and in general use source-code control, since it was a
long-term project).  Workspaces are also differentiated in what their
purpose is -- general working workspace, workspace for particular
projects, workspace keeping the latest copy of the code in one of the
branches without mods, etc.

@item
Various workspaces are subdirectories under @file{<xsrc-top>}, e.g.:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@file{<xsrc-top>/working} (the workspace you're actively working on,
periodically synched up with the latest trunk)

@item
@file{<xsrc-top>/stable} (for making changes to the stable version of
XEmacs, which sits on a branch)

@item
@file{<xsrc-top>/unsigned-removal} (a workspace for a specific, difficult
task that's going to affect lots of source and take a long time, and
so best done in its own workspace without the interference of other
work you're doing.  Also, you can commit just this one large change,
separate from all the other changes).

@item
@file{<xsrc-top>/latest} (a copy of the latest sources on the trunk,
i.e. the experimental version of XEmacs, with no patches in it;
either update it periodically, by hand, or set up a cron job to do it
automatically).  Set it up so it can be built, and build it so you
have a working XEmacs. (Building it might also go into the cron job.)

This workspace serves a number of purposes:
@enumerate
@item
You always have a recent version of XEmacs you can compare
against when something you're working on breaks.  It's true
that you can do this with cvs diff, but when you need to do
some serious investigation, this method just fails.
@item
You (almost) always have a working, up-to-date executable that
can be used when your executable is crashing and you need to
keep developing it, or when you need an `xemacs' to build
packages, etc.
@item
When creating new workspaces, you can just copy the `latest'
workspace using GNU @code{cp -a}.  You have all the .elc's built,
everything else probably configured, any spare files in place
(e.g. some annoying xpm.dll under Windows, etc.).
@end enumerate

@item
@file{<xsrc-top>/latest-stable/} (equivalent to @file{<xsrc-top>/latest/}, but
for the Stable branch of XEmacs, rather than the Experimental branch
of XEmacs).  This may or may not be necessary depending on how much
development you do of the stable branch.
@end itemize

@item
@file{<xsrc-top>/xemacsweb} is a workspace for working on the XEmacs
web site.

@item
@file{<xsrc-top>/in-patches} for patches received from email and saved
to files.

@item
@file{<xsrc-top>/out-patches} for locally-generated patches to be sent
to @email{xemacs-patches@@xemacs.org}.  Less useful now that the
patcher util has been developed.

@item
@file{<xsrc-top>/build}, for build trees when compiling and testing XEmacs with
various configuration options turned off and on.  The scripts in
xemacs-builds/ben (see below) can be used to automate building XEmacs
workspaces with many different configuration options and automatically
filtering out the normal output so that you see only the abnormal
output.

@item
@file{<xsrc-top>/xemacs-builds}, for the xemacs-builds module, which you need
to check out separately in CVS.  This contains scripts used for building
XEmacs, automating and simplifying using CVS, etc.  Under various
people's directories are their own build and other scripts.  The
currently most-maintained scripts are under ben/, where there are easily
configurable scripts that can be used to easily build any workspace
(esp. if you've more or less followed the layout presented above)
unattended, with one or more configuration states (there's a
pre-determined list of the most useful, but it's easy to change).  The
output is filtered and split up in various ways so that you can identify
which output came from where, and you can see the output either full or
with all "normal" output except occasional status messages filtered so
that you only see the abnormal ones.

@node Q1.5.5, Q1.6.1, Q1.5.4, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.5.5: What's the basic layout of the code?

The file @file{configure} is a shell script to acclimate XEmacs to the
oddities of your processor and operating system.  It will create a
file named @file{Makefile} (a script for the @file{make} program), which helps
automate the process of building and installing emacs.  See INSTALL
for more detailed information.

The file @file{configure.in} is the input used by the autoconf program to
construct the @file{configure} script.  Since XEmacs has configuration
requirements that autoconf can't meet, @file{configure.in} uses an unholy
marriage of custom-baked configuration code and autoconf macros; it
may be wise to avoid rebuilding @file{configure} from @file{configure.in} when
possible.

The file @file{Makefile.in} is a template used by @file{configure} to create
@file{Makefile}.

There are several subdirectories:

@enumerate
@item
@file{src} holds the C code for XEmacs (the XEmacs Lisp interpreter and its
primitives, the redisplay code, and some basic editing functions).
@item
@file{lisp} holds the XEmacs Lisp code for XEmacs (most everything else).
@item
@file{lib-src} holds the source code for some utility programs for use by
or with XEmacs, like movemail and etags.
@item
@file{etc} holds miscellaneous architecture-independent data files
XEmacs uses, like the tutorial text.  The contents of the @file{lisp},
@file{info} and @file{man} subdirectories are architecture-independent too.
@item
@file{lwlib} holds the C code for the X toolkit objects used by XEmacs.
@item
@file{info} holds the Info documentation tree for XEmacs.
@item
@file{man} holds the source code for the XEmacs online documentation.
@item
@file{nt} holds files used compiling XEmacs under Microsoft Windows.

@unnumberedsec 1.6: Politics (XEmacs vs. GNU Emacs)

@node Q1.6.1, Q1.6.2, Q1.5.5, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.6.1: What is GNU Emacs?

GNU Emacs and XEmacs are related open-source text editors.  Both
derive from GNU Emacs version 18; the split between the two happened
in 1991 (for comparison, the oldest versions of GNU Emacs date from
1984).  For information on GNU Emacs, see
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html}.

@node Q1.6.2, Q1.6.3, Q1.6.1, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.6.2: How does XEmacs differ from GNU Emacs?

For a detailed description of the differences between GNU Emacs and
XEmacs and a detailed history of XEmacs, check out the
@example
@uref{http://www.xemacs.org/About/XEmacsVsGNUemacs.html, NEWS file}
@end example

@table @strong
@item User-Visible Editing Features
XEmacs in general tries hard to conform to exist user-interface
standards, and to work "out-of-the-box" without the need for obscure
customization changes.  GNU Emacs, particularly version 21, has gotten
better about this (in many cases by copying the XEmacs behavior!), but
still has some weirdnesses.  For example, the standard method of
selecting text using the Shift key works out-of-the-box in XEmacs.

XEmacs has a built-in toolbar. Four toolbars can actually be configured
simultaneously: top, bottom, left, and right toolbars.

XEmacs has vertical and horizontal scrollbars. Unlike in GNU Emacs 19
(which provides a primitive form of vertical scrollbar), these are true
toolkit scrollbars. A look-alike Motif scrollbar is provided for those
who don't have Motif. (Even for those who do, the look-alike may be
preferable as it is faster.)

XEmacs has buffer tabs along the top of the frame (although the
position can be changed) that make it very easy to switch buffers.

The menubar under XEmacs is better-designed, with more thought put into
it.

XEmacs can ask questions using popup dialog boxes. Any command executed
from a menu will ask yes/no questions with dialog boxes, while commands
executed via the keyboard will use the minibuffer.

XEmacs under MS Windows provides uses the standard file-dialog box for
opening and saving files.  Standard menu-accelerator behavior can easily
be enabled using the Options menu, and integrates well into the existing
keymap.

XEmacs has (still experimental) support for widgets of various sorts --
buttons, text boxes, sliders, progress bars, etc.  A progress bar is
used in font lock to show the progress.

Experimental support for drag-and-drop protocols is provided from
XEmacs 21.

@item General Platform Support
If you're running on a machine with audio hardware, you can specify
sound files for XEmacs to play instead of the default X beep. See the
documentation of the function load-sound-file and the variable
sound-alist. XEmacs also supports the network sound protocols NAS and
EsounD.

XEmacs 21 supports database protocols with LISP bindings, currently
including Berkeley DB, LDAP, and PostgreSQL (21.2 only).

XEmacs 20 and 21 support the Canna, Wnn, and SJ3 Japanese input method
servers directly, as well as through the X Input Method (XIM)
protocol. GNU Emacs 20 supports only the XIM protocol. Both Emacsen
support the Quail family of input methods (implemented in LISP) for many
languages.

XEmacs provides support for ToolTalk on systems that have
it.

@item Packaged LISP Libraries
Many more packages are provided standard with XEmacs than with GNU Emacs
19 or 20.

XEmacs 21 supports an integrated package management system which uses
EFS to download, then automatically install prebuilt LISP
libraries. This allows XEmacs users much more straightforward access to
the "latest and greatest" version of any given library.

We are working on a standard method for enabling, disabling and
otherwise controlling packages, which should make them very easy to use.

@item LISP Programming
From XEmacs 20 on, characters are a separate type. Characters can be
converted to integers (and many integers can be converted to
characters), but characters are not integers. GNU Emacs 19, XEmacs 19,
Mule 2.3 (an extensive patch to GNU Emacs 18.55 and 19.x), and GNU Emacs
20 (incorporating Mule 3 and later Mule 4) represent them as integers.

From XEmacs 20 on, the buffer is treated as an array of characters, and
the representation of buffer text is not exposed to LISP. The GNU Emacs
20 functions like buffer-as-multibyte are not supported.

In XEmacs, events are first-class objects. GNU Emacs 19 represents them
as integers, which obscures the differences between a key gesture and
the ancient ASCII code used to represent a particular overlapping subset
of them.

In XEmacs, keymaps are first-class opaque objects. GNU Emacs 19
represents them as complicated combinations of association lists and
vectors. If you use the advertised functional interface to manipulation
of keymaps, the same code will work in XEmacs, GNU Emacs 18, and GNU
Emacs 19; if your code depends on the underlying implementation of
keymaps, it will not.

XEmacs uses "extents" to represent all non-textual aspects of buffers;
GNU Emacs 19 uses two distinct objects, "text properties" and
"overlays", which divide up the functionality between them. Extents are
a superset of the union of the functionality of the two GNU Emacs data
types. The full GNU Emacs 19 interface to text properties and overlays
is supported in XEmacs (with extents being the underlying
representation).

Extents can be made to be copied into strings, and then restored, by
kill and yank. Thus, one can specify this behavior on either "extents"
or "text properties", whereas in GNU Emacs 19 text properties always
have this behavior and overlays never do.

@item Window System Programming Interface
XEmacs uses the MIT "Xt" toolkit instead of raw Xlib calls, which makes
it be a more well-behaved X citizen (and also improves portability). A
result of this is that it is possible to include other Xt "Widgets" in
the XEmacs window. Also, XEmacs understands the standard Xt command-line
arguments.

XEmacs supports Motif applications, generic Xt (e.g. Athena)
applications, and raw Xlib applications. An XEmacs variant which
supports GTK+ is available (integration as an option in the XEmacs
mainline is planned for XEmacs 22), although code to take advantage of
the support is as yet scarce.

An XEmacs frame can be placed within an "external client widget" managed
by another application. This allows an application to use an XEmacs
frame as its text pane rather than the standard Text widget that is
provided with Motif or Athena.

@item Community Participation
Joining the XEmacs development team is simple. Mail to
@email{xemacs-beta@@xemacs.org, XEmacs Developers}, and you're in! (If
you want to be, of course. You're also welcome to just post
development-related questions and bug reports.) The GNU Emacs
development team and internal mailing lists are still by invitation
only.

The "bleeding edge" of mainline XEmacs development is available by
anonymous CVS as are some subsidiary branches (check out the xemacs-gtk
module for the latest in GUI features!)

Development and maintenance of Lisp libraries is separated from the core
editor development at a fairly low level. This provides better
modularization and a better division of responsibility between external
library maintainers and the XEmacs core development team. Even for
packages the size of Gnus, XEmacs users normally have access to a
pre-built version within a few weeks of a major release, and minor
updates often within days.

CVS commit authority is broadly dispersed. Recognized maintainers of
LISP libraries who are willing to maintain XEmacs packaged versions
automatically qualify for CVS accounts for their packages.

@node Q1.6.3, Q1.6.4, Q1.6.2, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.6.3: How much does XEmacs differ?

RMS has asserted at times that XEmacs is merely a "patch" on top of
GNU Emacs (@pxref{Q1.6.4}).  In fact, probably not more than 5% of the
code, if that, remains unchanged, and nearly 14 years of work has gone
into XEmacs at this point. (GNU Emacs itself is only than 20 years
old, and thus XEmacs has existed as a separate product for over 2/3 of
the lifespan of GNU Emacs.) As a point of comparison, XEmacs 21.5 has
perhaps 65,000 more lines of C code than GNU Emacs 21.2.

However, the XEmacs developers strive to keep their code compatible with
GNU Emacs, especially on the Lisp level.  Much effort goes into
"synching" the XEmacs Elisp code with recent GNU Emacs releases so as to
benefit from GNU Emacs development work. (In contrast, almost no code
from XEmacs has made it into GNU Emacs, and in fact the GNU Emacs
developers are instructed by RMS not to even look at XEmacs source code!
This stems from self-imposed licensing restrictions on the part of GNU
Emacs -- and almost certainly out of hostility, as well.)

@node Q1.6.4, Q1.6.5, Q1.6.3, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.6.4: Is XEmacs "GNU"?

RMS insists on the term "GNU XEmacs" and maintains that

@quotation
XEmacs is GNU software because it's a modified version of a
GNU program. And it is GNU software because the FSF is the copyright
holder for most of it, and therefore the legal responsibility for
protecting its free status falls on us whether we want it or not. This
is why the term "GNU XEmacs" is legitimate.
@end quotation

In fact, FSF is @emph{not} the copyright holder for most of the code,
as very little unmodified FSF code remains (@pxref{Q1.6.3}).

Furthermore, RMS's assertion that XEmacs is "GNU" seems rather bizarre
to the XEmacs developers given RMS's hostility and general lack of
interest in cooperation.  "GNU" software in general is part of the GNU
Project, is distributed by it on their FTP site, and receives support
(or at least cooperation), as well as implicit endorsement, from it.
The GNU Project, however, has never supported XEmacs and never
distributed XEmacs, and RMS's hostility is the farthest thing possible
from an endorsement.  In fact, the GNU Project distributes a number of
non-GNU software projects on the FSF web site, but again XEmacs is not
one of them.

@node Q1.6.5, Q1.6.6, Q1.6.4, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.6.5: What is the correct way to refer to XEmacs and GNU Emacs?

Unfortunately even the naming of these two applications has become
politicized.  Much of this stems from RMS, who has a history of
politicizing similar issues. (Compare the controversy over "Lignux"
and "GNU/Linux".) We would prefer that the terms "XEmacs" and "GNU
Emacs" be used, which are neutral and acceptable to most people.  RMS,
however, is not willing to accept these terms.  He insists that, if
his product is called "GNU Emacs", then ours must be called "GNU
XEmacs". (For our opinion of this term, @xref{Q1.6.4}.) On the other
hand, if our product is to be called "XEmacs", as we prefer, then his
product must simply be called "Emacs".  The intent of this seems
clear: RMS wants to make sure the names reflect his view that his
version is the "real" Emacs and ours is merely a derivative,
second-class product (@pxref{Q1.6.3}).

The XEmacs developers hope that you will use the neutral terms
"XEmacs" and "GNU Emacs" for these two specific products. "Emacs", on
the other hand, is a generic term for a class of programmable text
editors with a similar look-and-feel, and usually a Lisp-based
extension language.  These trace themselves back to early editors such
as EINE, ZWEI, ZMACS and Multics Emacs. @xref{A History of Emacs,,,
internals, XEmacs Internals Manual}.

We also call upon RMS, in the spirit of furthering cooperation, to
stop politicizing this issue and use the neutral terms "XEmacs" and
"GNU Emacs".  We have already acceded to RMS' wishes in this respect,
and we expect him to do the same. (In the past, the XEmacs developers
often used the terms "FSF Emacs" or "FSFmacs" or "RMSmacs" in
reference to GNU Emacs; these terms were apparently modeled after RMS'
own usage of "Gosmacs" and "Gosling Emacs" in reference to Unipress
Emacs, produced by James Gosling.  RMS, however, considers such terms
to be insulting, so we refrain from using them as much as possible in
preference to GNU Emacs.)

@node Q1.6.6, Q1.7.1, Q1.6.5, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.6.6: Why haven't XEmacs and GNU Emacs merged?

There are currently irreconcilable differences in the views about
technical, programming, design, organizational and legal matters
between Richard Stallman (RMS), the author and leader of the GNU Emacs
project, and the XEmacs development team which provide little hope for
a merge to take place in the short-term future.  There have been
repeated attempts at merging by all of the major XEmacs developers,
starting from the early days of Lucid Emacs (in 1991), but they have
all failed.  RMS has very strong views about how GNU Emacs should be
structured and how his project should be run, and during the repeated
merge efforts has never demonstrated any realistic interest in
sufficiently compromising or ceding control to allow a middle ground
to be found.  The basic problem seems to be the very different goals
of RMS and the XEmacs project.  The primary goals of the XEmacs
project are technical and organizational -- we want to create the best
editor possible, and to make it as easy as possible for people around
the world to contribute.  The primary goals of RMS, on the other hand,
are political, and GNU Emacs, and any potential merge efforts with
XEmacs, are strictly subservient to these goals.  In fact, in many
ways RMS sees GNU Emacs as the "poster child" of his aims, the one
program in the GNU project that above all others must set an example
to the world. (This has to do with the fact that GNU Emacs was the
first program in the GNU project, and the only one that he is still
personally involved with on a day-to-day basis.)  Given his goals, his
position is completely reasonable -- but unfortunately, makes any
merge impossible.

From the XEmacs perspective, the most intractable issues appear to be
legal and organizational, specifically:

@itemize @bullet
@item
RMS requires "legal papers" to be signed for all contributions of code
to GNU Emacs over 10 lines or so, transferring the copyright and all
legal rights to the code to the Free Software Foundation.  XEmacs does
not and has never required this, since it has the practical effect of
discouraging individual and in particular corporate contributions --
corporations will almost never sign away their legal rights to code
since it makes it impossible to reuse the code in any product that
whose license is not compatible with the GNU General Public License.
Since RMS has shown no inclination to compromise on this issue, a
merge would require that most of the existing XEmacs code would need
to be thrown away and rewritten -- something the XEmacs developers are
understandably reluctant to do.

@item 
A repeated stumbling block in the merge talks has been the issue of
organizational control over the resulting product.  RMS has made it
clear that he intends to have final say over design issues in a merged
Emacs.  Unfortunately, RMS and the XEmacs developers have repeatedly
clashed over design decisions, and RMS' insistence on getting his way
in such disagreements was the very reason for the split in the first
place.  This same issue has come up again and again in merge talks and
we have never been able to come to a satisfactory resolution.  To the
extent that RMS is willing to compromise at all, it appears to be of a
purely political rather than technical nature -- "If we support this
feature of yours, we also get to support this other feature of mine."
The XEmacs developers cannot see how such a process would lead to
anything but a mess of incompatible things hodgepodged together.

@item
Because of the years of separate development, distinct and
incompatible interfaces have developed and merging would be extremely
difficult even with the above non-technical issues resolved.  The
problem has been exacerbated by the issue of legal papers -- because
XEmacs code is not "kosher" from RMS' perspective, he discourages
developers from even looking at it out of legal concerns.  Although it
is still possible to read the XEmacs documentation and run the
program, the practical effect of this prohibition has been to strongly
discourage code-sharing and cooperative development -- although a
great deal of GNU Emacs code has been incorporated into XEmacs,
practically none has gone the other direction.

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.7.1: What is the package system?

In order to reduce the size and increase the maintainability of

system.  Each elisp add-on (or groups of them when they are small) now
comes in its own tarball that contains a small search hierarchy.

You select just the ones you need.  Install them by untarring them into

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.7.3: Do I need to have the packages to run XEmacs?

Strictly speaking, no.  XEmacs will build and install just fine without
any packages installed.  However, only the most basic editing functions
will be available with no packages installed, so installing packages is
an essential part of making your installed XEmacs _useful_.

@node Q1.7.4, Q1.8.1, Q1.7.3, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.7.4: Is there a way to find which package has particular functionality?

If you want to find out which package contains the functionality you
are looking for, use @kbd{M-x package-get-package-provider}, and give it a
symbol that is likely to be in that package.  

For example, if some code you want to use has a @code{(require 'thingatpt)}
in it:

@example
	M-x package-get-package-provider RET thingatpt RET
@end example

which will return something like: @samp{(fsf-compat "1.08").}

@unnumberedsec 1.8: Internationalization

@node Q1.8.1, Q1.8.2, Q1.7.4, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.8.1: What is the status of internationalization support aka MULE (including Asian language support)?

Both the stable and development versions of XEmacs include
internationalization support (aka MULE).  MULE currently (21.4) works on
UNIX and Linux systems.  It is possible to build with MULE on Windows
systems, but if you really need MULE on Windows, it is recommended that
you build and use the development (21.5) version, and deal with the
instability of the development tree.  Binaries compiled without MULE
support run faster than MULE capable XEmacsen.

@node Q1.8.2, Q1.8.3, Q1.8.1, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.8.2: How can I help with internationalization?

If you would like to help, you may want to join the
@email{xemacs-mule@@xemacs.org} mailing list.  Especially needed are
people who speak/write languages other than English, who are willing to
use XEmacs/MULE regularly, and have some experience with Elisp.

Translations of the TUTORIAL and man page are welcome, and XEmacs does
support multilingual menus, but we have few current translations.

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.8.4: Can XEmacs messages come out in a different language?

The message-catalog support was written but is badly bit-rotted.  XEmacs
20 and 21 did @emph{not} support it, and early releases of XEmacs 22
will not either.

However, menubar localization @emph{does} work.  To enable it, add to
your @file{Emacs} file entries like this:

@example
Emacs*XlwMenu.resourceLabels:                   True
Emacs*XlwMenu.file.labelString:                 Fichier
Emacs*XlwMenu.openInOtherWindow.labelString: 	In anderem Fenster oeffnen
@end example

The name of the resource is derived from the non-localized entry by
removing punctuation and capitalizing as above.

@node Q1.8.5, Q1.8.6, Q1.8.4, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.8.5: Please explain the various input methods in MULE/XEmacs

Mule supports a wide variety of input methods.  There are three basic
classes: Lisp implementations, generic platform support, and library
interfaces.

@emph{Lisp implementations} include Quail, which provides table-driven input
methods for almost all the character sets that Mule supports (including
all of the ISO 8859 family, the Indic languages, Thai, and so on), and
SKK, for Japanese.  (SKK also supports an interface to an external
"dictionary server" process.)  Quail supports both typical "dead-key"
methods (eg, in the "latin-1-prefix" method, @kbd{" a} produces , LATIN
SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS), and the complex dictionary-based phonetic
methods used for Asian ideographic languages like Chinese.

Lisp implementations can be less powerful (but they are not perceptibly
inefficient), and of course are not portable to non-Emacs applications.
The incompatibility can be very annoying.  On the other hand, they
require no special platform support or external libraries, so if you can
display the characters, Mule can input them for you and you can edit,
anywhere.

@emph{Generic platform support} is currently limited to the X Input
Method (XIM) framework, although support for MSIME (for MS Windows) is
planned, and IIIMF (Sun's Internet-Intranet Input Method Framework)
support is extremely desirable.  XIM is enabled at build time by use of
the @samp{--with-xim} flag to @code{configure}.  For use of XIM, see
your platform documentation.  However, normally the input method you use
is specified via the @samp{LANG} and @samp{XMODIFIERS} environment
variables.

Of course, input skills are portable across most applications.  However,
especially in modern GUI systems the habit of using bucky bits has
fallen into sad disuse, and many XIM systems are poorly configured for
use with Emacs.  For example, the kinput2 input manager (a separate
process providing an interface between Japanese dictionary servers such
as Canna and Wnn, and the application) tends to gobble up keystrokes
generating Meta characters.  This means that to edit while using an XIM
input method, you must toggle the input method off every time you want
to use @kbd{M-f}.  Your mileage may vary.

@emph{Library interfaces} are most common for Japanese, although Wnn
supports Chinese (traditional and simplified) and Korean.  There are
Chinese and Korean input servers available, but we do not know of any
patches for XEmacs to use them directly.  You can use them via
IM-enabled terminals, by manipulating the terminal coding systems.  We
describe only the Japanese-oriented systems here.  The advantage of
these systems is that they are very powerful, and on platforms where
they are available there is typically a wide range of applications that
support them.  Thus your input skills are portable across applications.

Mule provides built-in interfaces to the following input methods: Wnn4,
Wnn6, Canna, and SJ3.  These can be configured at build time.  There are
patches available (no URL, sorry) to support the SKK server, as well.
Wnn and SJ3 use the @code{egg} user interface.  The interface for Canna
is specialized to Canna.

Wnn supports Japanese, Chinese and Korean. It is made by OMRON and Kyto
University. It is a powerful and complex system.  Wnn4 is free and Wnn6
is not.  Wnn uses grammatical hints and probability of word association,
so in principle Wnn can be cleverer than other methods.

Canna, made by NEC, supports only Japanese.  It is a simple and powerful
system. Canna uses only grammar, but its grammar and dictionary are
quite sophisticated.  So for standard modern Japanese, Canna seems
cleverer than Wnn4. In addition, the UNIX version of Canna is free (now
there is a Microsoft Windows version).

SJ3, by Sony, supports only Japanese.

Egg consists of following parts:

@enumerate
@item
Input character Translation System (ITS) layer.
It translates ASCII inputs to Kana/PinYin/Hangul characters.

@item
Kana/PinYin/Hangul to Kanji transfer layer.
The interface layer to network Kana-Kanji server (Wnn and Sj3).
@end enumerate

These input methods are modal.  They have a raw (alphabet) mode, a
phonetic input mode, and Kana-Kanji transfer mode.  However there are
mode-less input methods for Egg and Canna.  @samp{boiled-egg} is a
mode-less input method running on Egg.  For Canna, @samp{canna.el} has a
tiny boiled-egg-like command, @code{(canna-boil)}, and there are some
boiled-egg-like utilities.

Much of this information was provided by @email{morioka@@jaist.ac.jp,
MORIOKA Tomohiko}.

@node Q1.8.6, Q1.8.7, Q1.8.5, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.8.6: How do I portably code for MULE/XEmacs?

MULE has evolved rapidly over the last few years, and the original third
party patch (for GNU Emacs 19), GNU Emacs 20+, and XEmacs 20+ have quite
different implementations.  The APIs also vary although recent versions
of XEmacs have tended to converge to the GNU Emacs standard.

MULE implementations are going to continue to evolve.  Both GNU Emacs
and XEmacs are working hard on Unicode support, which will involve new
APIs and probably variations on old ones.  For XEmacs 22, the old ISO
2022-based system for recognizing encodings will be replaced by a much
more flexible system, which should improve accuracy of automatic coding
detections, but will also involve new APIs.

@email{morioka@@jaist.ac.jp, MORIOKA Tomohiko} writes:

@quotation
The application implementor must write separate code for these mule
variants.  [Please don't hesitate to report these variants to us; they
are not, strictly speaking, bugs, but they give third-party developers
the same kind of creepy-crawly feeling.  We'll do what we can. -- Ed.]

MULE and the next version of Emacs are similar but the symbols are very
different---requiring separate code as well.

Namely we must support 3 kinds of mule variants and 4 or 5 or 6 kinds of
emacs variants... (;_;) I'm shocked, so I wrote a wrapper package called
@code{emu} to provide a common interface.  [There is an XEmacs package
of APEL which provides much more comprehensive coverage.  Be careful,
however; APEL has problems of its own. -- Ed.]

I have the following suggestions about dealing with mule variants:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{(featurep 'mule)} @code{t} on all mule variants

@item
@code{(boundp 'MULE)} is @code{t} on only MULE.  Maybe the next version
of Emacs will not have this symbol.

@item
MULE has a variable @code{mule-version}.  Perhaps the next version of
Emacs will have this variable as well.
@end itemize

Following is a sample to distinguish mule variants:

@lisp
(if (featurep 'mule)
    (cond ((boundp 'MULE)

          ((string-match "XEmacs" emacs-version)

@node Q1.8.8, Q1.8.9, Q1.8.7, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.8.8: Does XEmacs support Unicode?

To get Unicode support, you need a Mule-enabled XEmacs.

21.5 has internal support for Unicode and supports it fully, although we
don't yet use it as the internal encoding.

21.4 supports Unicode partially -- as an external encoding for files,
processes, and terminals, but without font support.  @xref{Q1.8.9, How
does XEmacs display Unicode?}.  To get Unicode support in 21.4,
install Mule-UCS from packages in the usual way, and put

@example
(require 'un-define)
(set-coding-priority-list '(utf-8))
(set-coding-category-system 'utf-8 'utf-8)
@end example

in your init file to enable the UTF-8 coding system.  You may wish to
view the documentation of @code{set-coding-priority-list} if you find
that files that are not UTF-8 are being mis-recognized as UTF-8.

Install standard national fonts (not Unicode fonts) for all character
sets you use.  @xref{Q1.8.9, How does XEmacs display Unicode??}.

Mule-UCS also supports 16-bit forms of Unicode (UTF-16).  It does not
support 31-bit forms of Unicode (UTF-32 or UCS-4).

@node Q1.8.9,  , Q1.8.8, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.8.9: How does XEmacs display Unicode?

Mule doesn't have a Unicode charset internally, so there's nothing to
bind a Unicode registry to.  It would not be straightforward to create,
either, because Unicode is not ISO 2022-compatible.  You'd have to
translate it to multiple 96x96 pages.

This means that Mule-UCS uses ordinary national fonts for display.  This
is not really a problem, except for those languages that use the Unified
Han characters.  The problem here is that Mule-UCS maps from Unicode
code points to national character sets in a deterministic way.  By
default, this means that Japanese fonts are tried first, then Chinese,
then Korean.  To change the priority ordering, use the command
`un-define-change-charset-order'.

It also means you can't use Unicode fonts directly, at least not without
extreme hackery.  You can run -nw with (set-terminal-coding-system
'utf-8) if you really want a Unicode font for some reason.

Real Unicode support will be introduced in XEmacs 22.0.

@node Q2.0.3, Q2.0.4, Q2.0.2, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.0.3: How do I specify the paths that XEmacs uses for finding files?

You can specify what paths to use by using a number of different flags
when running configure.  See the section MAKE VARIABLES in the top-level
file INSTALL in the XEmacs distribution for a listing of those flags.

Most of the time, however, the simplest fix is: @strong{do not} specify
paths as you might for GNU Emacs.  XEmacs can generally determine the
necessary paths dynamically at run time.  The only path that generally
needs to be specified is the root directory to install into.  That can
be specified by passing the @code{--prefix} flag to configure.  For a
description of the XEmacs install tree, please consult the @file{NEWS}
file.

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.0.4: Running XEmacs without installing

How can I just try XEmacs without installing it?

XEmacs will run in place without requiring installation and copying of
the Lisp directories, and without having to specify a special build-time
flag.  It's the copying of the Lisp directories that requires so much
space.  XEmacs is largely written in Lisp.

A good method is to make a shell alias for xemacs:

@example
alias xemacs=/src/xemacs-21.5/src/xemacs
@end example

(You will obviously use whatever directory you downloaded the source
tree to instead of @file{/src/xemacs-21.5}).

This will let you run XEmacs without massive copying.

@node Q2.0.5, Q2.1.1, Q2.0.4, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.0.5: XEmacs is too big

The space required by the installation directories can be
reduced dramatically if desired.  Gzip all the .el files.  Remove all
the packages you'll never want to use.  Remove the TexInfo manuals.
Remove the Info (and use just hardcopy versions of the manual).  Remove
most of the stuff in etc.  Remove or gzip all the source code.  Gzip or
remove the C source code.  Configure it so that copies are not made of
the support lisp.

These are all Emacs Lisp source code and bytecompiled object code.  You
may safely gzip everything named *.el here.  You may remove any package
you don't use.  @emph{Nothing bad will happen if you delete a package
that you do not use}.  You must be sure you do not use it though, so be
conservative at first.

Any package with the possible exceptions of xemacs-base, and EFS are
candidates for removal.  Ask yourself, @emph{Do I ever want to use this
package?}  If the answer is no, then it is a candidate for removal.

First, gzip all the .el files.  Then go about package by package and
start gzipping the .elc files.  Then run XEmacs and do whatever it is
you normally do.  If nothing bad happens, then remove the package.  You
can remove a package via the PUI interface 
(@code{M-x pui-list-packages}, then press @kbd{d} to mark the packages
you wish to delete, and then @kbd{x} to delete them.

Another method is to do @code{M-x package-get-delete-package}.

@item
Manually, all at once, using the 'Sumo Tarball'.
@item
Manually, using individual package tarballs.
@item
Automatically, using the package tools from XEmacs.
@end enumerate

If you don't want to mess with the packages, it is easiest to just
grab them manually, all at once. (For the other two ways,
@xref{Q2.1.2}, and @xref{Q2.1.3}.) Download the file

@file{xemacs-sumo.tar.gz}

For an XEmacs compiled with Mule you also need

@file{xemacs-mule-sumo.tar.gz}

These are in the @file{packages} directory on your XEmacs mirror
archive: @uref{ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/packages} or its
mirrors.  N.B. They are called 'Sumo Tarballs' for good reason. They
are currently about 19MB and 4.5MB (gzipped) respectively.

Install them on Unix and Mac OS X using the shell/Terminal command

@code{cd $prefix/lib/xemacs ; gunzip -c <tarballname> | tar xf -}

Where @samp{$prefix} is what you gave to the @samp{--prefix} flag to
@file{configure}, and defaults to @file{/usr/local}.

If you have GNU tar you can use:

@code{cd $prefix/lib/xemacs ; tar zxvf <tarballname>}

If you have the packages somewhere nonstandard and don't want to bother
with @samp{$prefix} (for example, you're a developer and are compiling
the packages yourself, and want your own private copy of everything),
you can also directly specify this using @file{configure}.  To do this
with 21.5 and above use the @samp{--with-package-prefix} parameter to
specify the directory under which you untarred the above tarballs.
Under 21.4 and previous you need to use @samp{--package-path}.  Using
these options looks something like this:

@example
   configure --package-path="~/.xemacs::/src/xemacs/site-packages:/src/xemacs/xemacs-packages:/src/xemacs/mule-packages" ...
@end example

Under Windows, you need to place the above @samp{tar.gz} files in the
directory specified using the @samp{PACKAGE_PREFIX} value in
@file{nt/config.inc} and by default is @file{\Program Files\XEmacs}.
(To untar a @samp{tar.gz} file you will need to use a utility such as
WinZip, unless you have Cygwin or a similar environment installed, in
which case the above Unix shell command should work fine.) If you want
the packages somewhere else, just change @samp{PACKAGE_PREFIX}.

Note that XEmacs finds the packages automatically anywhere underneath
the directory tree where it expects to find the packages.  All you
need to do is put stuff there; you don't need to run any program to
tell XEmacs to find the packges, or do anything of that sort.

However, XEmacs will only notice newly installed packages when it
starts up, so you will have to restart if you are already running
XEmacs.

For more details, @xref{Startup Paths,,,xemacs, the XEmacs User's
Manual}, and @xref{Packages,,,xemacs, the XEmacs User's Manual}.

As the Sumo tarballs are not regenerated as often as the individual
packages, it is recommended that you use the automatic package tools
afterwards to pick up any recent updates.

@emph{NOTE}: For detailed information about how the package
hierarchies work, @xref{Package Overview,,,lispref, the XEmacs Lisp
Reference Manual}.

@node Q2.1.2, Q2.1.3, Q2.1.1, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.1.2: Can I install the packages individually?

Yes, you can download individual packages from the FTP site (@pxref{Q2.1.1}).  Since packages are automatically noticed at startup, you just have to put them in the right place.

Note: If you are upgrading packages already installed, it's best to
remove the old package first (@pxref{Q2.1.4}).

For example if we are installing the @samp{xemacs-base}
package (version 1.48):

@example
   mkdir $prefix/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages RET # if it does not exist yet
   cd $prefix/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages RET
   gunzip -c /path/to/xemacs-base-1.48-pkg.tar.gz | tar xvf - RET
@end example

Or if you have GNU tar, the last step can be:

@example
   tar zxvf /path/to/xemacs-base-1.48-pkg.tar.gz RET
@end example

For MULE related packages, it is best to untar into the @samp{mule-packages}
hierarchy, i.e. for the @samp{mule-base} package, version 1.37:

@example
   mkdir $prefix/lib/xemacs/mule-packages RET # if it does not exist yet
   cd $prefix/lib/xemacs/mule-packages RET
   gunzip -c /path/to/mule-base-1.37-pkg.tar.gz | tar xvf - RET
@end example

Or if you have GNU tar, the last step can be:

@example
   tar zxvf /path/to/mule-base-1.37-pkg.tar.gz RET
@end example

@node Q2.1.3, Q2.1.4, Q2.1.2, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.1.3: Can I install the packages automatically?

XEmacs comes with some tools to make the periodic updating and
installing easier. It will notice if new packages or versions are
available and will fetch them from the FTP site.

Unfortunately this requires that a few packages are already in place.
You will have to install them by hand as above or use a SUMO tarball.
This requirement will hopefully go away in the future. The packages
you need are:

@example
   efs          - To fetch the files from the FTP site or mirrors.
   xemacs-base  - Needed by efs.
@end example

and optionally:

@example
   mailcrypt    - For PGP verification of the package-index file.
@end example

After installing these by hand, fire up XEmacs and follow these
steps.

@enumerate
@item
Choose a download site.
@itemize @bullet
@item
via menu: Tools -> Packages -> Set Download Site 
@item
via keyb: M-x customize-variable RET package-get-remote RET
(put in the details of remote host and directory)
@end itemize

If the package tarballs _AND_ the package-index file are in a
local directory, you can: M-x pui-set-local-package-get-directory RET

@item
Obtain a list of packages and display the list in a buffer named
"*Packages*".
@itemize @bullet
@item
menu: Tools -> Packages -> List & Install
@item
keyb: M-x pui-list-packages RET
@end itemize

XEmacs will now connect to the remote site and download the
latest package-index file.

The resulting buffer, "*Packages*" has brief instructions at the
end of the buffer.

@item
Choose the packages you wish to install.
@itemize @bullet
@item
mouse: Click button 2 on the package name.
@item
keyb: RET on the package name
@end itemize

@item
Make sure you have everything you need.
@itemize @bullet
@item
menu: Packages -> Add Required
@item
keyb: r
@end itemize

XEmacs will now search for packages that are required by the
ones that you have chosen to install and offer to select
those packages also.

For novices and gurus alike, this step can save your bacon.
It's easy to forget to install a critical package.

@item
Download and install the packages.

@node Q2.1.4, Q2.1.5, Q2.1.3, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.1.4: Can I upgrade or remove packages?

As the exact files and their locations contained in a package may
change it is recommended to remove a package first before installing a
new version. In order to facilitate removal each package contains an
pgkinfo/MANIFEST.pkgname file which list all the files belong to the
package. M-x package-admin-delete-binary-package RET can be used to
remove a package using this file.

Note that the interactive package tools included with XEmacs already do
this for you.

@node Q2.1.5, Q2.1.6, Q2.1.4, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.1.5: Which packages to install?

Unless you are an advanced user, just install everything.

If you really want to install only what's absolutely needed, a good
minimal set of packages for XEmacs-latin1 would be

@example
xemacs-base, xemacs-devel, c-support, cc-mode, debug, dired, efs,
edit-utils, fsf-compat, mail-lib, net-utils, os-utils, prog-modes,
text-modes, time, mailcrypt
@end example

If you are using the XEmacs package tools, don't forget to do:

@example
	Packages -> Add Required
@end example

To make sure you have everything that the packages you have chosen to
install need.

@xref{Q1.7.2}, for a description of the various packages.

@node Q2.1.6, Q2.1.7, Q2.1.5, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.1.6: Can you describe the package location process in more detail?

On startup XEmacs looks for packages in so-called package hierarchies.
Normally, there are three system wide hierarchies, like this:

@example
$prefix/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages/
     Normal packages go here.

$prefix/lib/xemacs/mule-packages/
     Mule packages go here and are only searched by MULE-enabled XEmacsen.

$prefix/lib/xemacs/site-packages/
     Local and 3rd party packages go here.
@end example

This is what you get when you untar the SUMO tarballs under
@file{$prefix/lib/xemacs}.

@file{$prefix} is specified using the @samp{--prefix} parameter to
@file{configure}, and defaults to @file{usr/local}.

If the package path is not explicitly specified, XEmacs looks for the
package directory @file{xemacs-packages} (and @file{mule-packages} and
@file{site-packages}) first under @samp{~/.xemacs}, then for a sister
directory @file{lib/xemacs-VERSION} of the directory in which the
XEmacs executable is located, then for a sister directory
@file{lib/xemacs}.  The XEmacs executable (under Unix at least) is
installed by default in @file{/usr/local/bin}; this explains why
XEmacs in its default installation will find packages that you put
under @file{/usr/local/lib/xemacs}.

You can specify where exactly XEmacs looks for packages by using the
@samp{--with-package-prefix} or @samp{--with-package-path} parameters to
@file{configure} (or the equivalent settings in @file{config.inc}, under
Windows), or setting the @samp{EMACSPACKAGEPATH} environment variable
(which has the same format as @samp{--with-package-path}).  @xref{Q2.1.1}.

See @file{configure.usage} for more info about the format of these
@file{configure} parameters.

In addition to the system wide packages, each user can have his own
packages installed under @file{~/.xemacs/}. If you want to install
packages there using the interactive tools, you need to set
@code{package-get-install-to-user-init-directory} to @code{t}.

The site-packages hierarchy replaces the old @file{site-lisp}
directory.  XEmacs no longer looks into a @file{site-lisp} directly by
default.  A good place to put @file{site-start.el} would be in
@file{$prefix/lib/xemacs/site-packages/lisp/}.

If your libraries are in a non-standard location, you can specify the location

@example
--site-libraries=WHATEVER
--site-includes=WHATEVER

Under 21.5 or later:

--site-libraries='/path/one /path/two /path/etc'
@end example

If the libraries and headers reside in the directories @samp{lib} and
@samp{include} of a common root (say @samp{/sw}) then both can be

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.2.2: Why can't I strip XEmacs?

@email{cognot@@fronsac.ensg.u-nancy.fr, Richard Cognot} writes:

@quotation
Because of the way XEmacs (and every other Emacsen, AFAIK) is built. The
link gives you a bare-boned emacs (called temacs). temacs is then run,
preloading some of the lisp files. The result is then dumped into a new
executable, named xemacs, which will contain all of the preloaded lisp
functions and data.

Now, during the dump itself, the executable (code+data+symbols) is
written on disk using a special unexec() function. This function is
obviously heavily system dependent. And on some systems, it leads to an
executable which, although valid, cannot be stripped without damage. If
memory serves, this is especially the case for AIX binaries. On other
architectures it might work OK.

The Right Way to strip the emacs binary is to strip temacs prior to
dumping xemacs. This will always work, although you can do that only if
you install from sources (as temacs is @file{not} part of the binary
kits).

The X11R6 distribution was monolithic, but the X11R7 distribution is
much more modular.  Many OS distributions omit these bitmaps (assuming
nobody uses them, evidently).  Your OS distribution should have a
developer's package containing these files, probably with a name
containing the string "bitmap".  Known package names (you may need to
add an extension such as .deb or .rpm) include x11/xbitmaps (Ubuntu)
and xorg-x11-xbitmaps (Fedora Core 5).

@unnumberedsec 2.3: Windows Installation (Windows, Cygwin, MinGW)

@node Q2.3.1, Q2.3.2, Q2.2.3, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.3.1: What exactly are all the different ways to build XEmacs under Windows?

XEmacs can be built in several ways in the MS Windows environment.

The standard way is what we call the "native" port.  It uses the Win32
API and has no connection with X whatsoever -- it does not require X
libraries to build, nor does it require an X server to run.  The native
port is the most reliable version and provides the best graphical
support.  Almost all development is geared towards this version, and
there is little reason not to use it.

The second way to build is the Cygwin port.  It takes advantage of
Cygnus emulation library under Win32.  @xref{Q1.2.5, What are Cygwin
and MinGW, and do I need them to run XEmacs?}, for more information.

A third way is the MinGW port.  It uses the Cygwin environment to
build but does not require it at runtime.  @xref{Q1.2.5, What are
Cygwin and MinGW, and do I need them to run XEmacs?}, for more
information.

Finally, you might also be able to build the non-Cygwin, non-MinGW "X"
port.  This was actually the first version of XEmacs that ran under MS
Windows, and although the code is still in XEmacs, it's essentially
orphaned and it's unlikely it will compile without a lot of work.  If
you want an MS Windows versin of XEmacs that supports X, use the Cygwin
version. (The X support there is actively maintained, so that Windows
developers can test the X support in XEmacs.)

@node Q2.3.2, Q2.3.3, Q2.3.1, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.3.2: What compiler/libraries do I need to compile XEmacs?

You need Visual C++ 4.2, 5.0, or 6.0 for the native version. (We have
some beta testers currently trying to compile with VC.NET, aka version
7.0, but we can't yet report complete success.) For the Cygwin and
MinGW versions, you need the Cygwin environment, which comes with GCC,
the compiler used for those versions.  @xref{Q1.2.5, What are Cygwin
and MinGW, and do I need them to run XEmacs?}, for more information on
Cygwin and MinGW.

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.3.4: What do I need for Cygwin?

You can find the Cygwin tools and compiler at:

@uref{http://www.cygwin.com/}

Click on the @samp{Install or update now!} link, which will download a
file @file{setup.exe}, which you can use to download everything
else. (You will need to pick a mirror site; @samp{mirrors.rcn.net} is
probably the best.) You should go ahead and install everything --
you'll get various ancillary libraries that XEmacs needs or likes,
e.g. XPM, PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc.  You can also get X Windows here, if you
want to compile under X.

If you want to compile without X, you will need the @file{xpm-nox}
library, which must be specifically selected in the Cygwin netinstaller;
it is not selected by default.  The package has had various names.
Currently it is called @file{cygXpm-noX4.dll}.

@node Q2.3.5, Q2.3.6, Q2.3.4, Installation

Similar as on Unix; use the usual `configure' and `make' process.
Some problems to watch out for:

@itemize @bullet
@item

@file{init.el} file comes from;

@item
@samp{CYGWIN} needs to be set to @samp{tty} for process support to work;

@item
picking up some other grep or other UNIX-like tools can kill configure;

@item
static heap too small, adjust @file{src/sheap-adjust.h} to a more positive
number;

@item
(Unconfirmed) The Cygwin version doesn't understand
@file{//machine/path} type paths so you will need to manually mount a
directory of this form under a unix style directory for a build to work
on the directory;

@item
If you're building @strong{WITHOUT} X11, don't forget to change symlinks
@file{/usr/lib/libXpm.a} and @file{/usr/lib/libXpm.dll.a} to point to
the non-X versions of these libraries.  By default they point to the X
versions.  So:

@example
/usr/lib/libXpm.a     -> /usr/lib/libXpm-noX.a
/usr/lib/libXpm.dll.a -> /usr/lib/libXpm-noX.dll.a
@end example

(This advice may now be obsolete because of the availability of the
cygXpm-noX4.dll package from Cygwin.  Send confirmation to
@email{faq@@xemacs.org}.)

should automatically find the X libraries and compile with X support.

As noted above, the non-Cygwin X support is basically orphaned, and
probably won't work.  But if it want to try, it's described in
@file{nt/README} in some detail.  Basically, you need to get X11
libraries from @uref{http://ftp.x.org}, and compile them.  If the

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.4.2: Help!  XEmacs just crashed on me!

First of all, don't panic.  Whenever XEmacs crashes, it tries extremely
hard to auto-save all of your files before dying.  (The main time that
this will not happen is if the machine physically lost power or if you
killed the XEmacs process using @code{kill -9}).  The next time you try
to edit those files, you will be informed that a more recent auto-save
file exists.  You can use @kbd{M-x recover-file} to retrieve the
auto-saved version of the file.

You can use the command @kbd{M-x recover-session} after a crash to pick
up where you left off.

Now, XEmacs is not perfect, and there may occasionally be times, or
particular sequences of actions, that cause it to crash.  If you can
come up with a reproducible way of doing this (or even if you have a
pretty good memory of exactly what you were doing at the time), the
maintainers would be very interested in knowing about it.  The best
way to report a bug is using @kbd{M-x report-emacs-bug} (or by
selecting @samp{Send Bug Report...} from the Help menu).  If that
won't work (e.g. you can't get XEmacs working at all), send ordinary
mail to @email{xemacs-beta@@xemacs.org}. @emph{MAKE SURE} to include
the output from the crash, especially including the Lisp backtrace, as
well as the XEmacs configuration from @kbd{M-x describe-installation}
(or equivalently, the file @file{Installation} in the top of the build
tree).  Note that the developers do @emph{not} usually follow
@samp{comp.emacs.xemacs} on a regular basis; thus, this is better for
general questions about XEmacs than bug reports.

If at all possible, include a C stack backtrace of the core dump that
was produced.  This shows where exactly things went wrong, and makes
it much easier to diagnose problems.  To do this under Unix and Mac OS
X, you need to locate the core file (it's called @file{core}, and is
usually sitting in the directory that you started XEmacs from, or your
home directory if that other directory was not writable).  Then, go to
that directory and execute a command like:

@example
gdb `which xemacs` core
@end example

and then issue the command @samp{where} to get the stack backtrace.  You
might have to use @code{dbx} or some similar debugger in place of
@code{gdb}.  If you don't have any such debugger available, complain to
your system administrator.

It's possible that a core file didn't get produced or the stack trace
from gdb is garbage, in which case you're out of luck unless you can
reproduce the bug.  A nonexistent core file can happen in some
circumstances on some operating systems, depending on what exactly
triggered the crash.  It's also possible, however, that your limits
are set to turn them off.  You may be able to reenable them using a
command like @samp{unlimit coredumpsize} or @samp{ulimit -c}. (To find
out how your limits are set, use the command @samp{limit}.) However, if
you didn't explicitly set your limits this way, go complain to your
system administrator and tell him not to disable core files by
default.

A garbaged stack trace can happen for various reasons.  Some versions
of gdb are broken on certain operating systems and aren't able to read
the core file.  It's also possible that the stack got overwritten
during the crash.  A very simple reason, however, is that your version
of XEmacs was compiled without debugging information or had the
debugging information stripped.  A compilation with optimization can
also result in partly or completely garbaged stack trace.  In such
cases, you will need to recompile XEmacs with debugging information
and without optimization; @xref{Q2.4.4, How to debug an XEmacs problem
with a debugger}.  Note also that core files currently don't work at
all under Cygwin, and the only way to get a backtrace is to run XEmacs
from gdb.

If you cannot get a backtrace from the core dump, but can reproduce
the problem, try running XEmacs under gdb.  The goal is to get clean C
and Lisp backtraces and submit a bug report including full
configuration information as described above, as this will greatly
assist in the process of tracking down the bug.  However, even partial
information is better than none.  The process of getting backtraces
from gdb is described in detail in @ref{Q2.4.4, How to debug an XEmacs
problem with a debugger}.

If you're under Microsoft Windows, you're out of luck unless you happen
to have a debugging aid installed on your system, for example Visual
C++.  In this case, the crash will result in a message giving you the
option to enter a debugger (for example, by pressing @samp{Cancel}).  Do
this and locate the stack-trace window. (If your XEmacs was built
without debugging information, the stack trace may not be very useful.)

When making a problem report make sure that:

@enumerate
@item
Report @strong{all} of the information output by XEmacs during the
crash.

@item
You mention what O/S and Hardware you are running XEmacs on.

@item
What version of XEmacs you are running.

@item
What build options you are using.

@item
If the problem is related to graphics and you are running Unix or Mac
OS X, we will also need to know what version of the X Window System
you are running, and what window manager you are using.

@item
If the problem happened on a TTY, please include the terminal type.

@item
Try very hard to get both C and Lisp backtraces, as described above.
@end enumerate

Much of the information above is automatically generated by @kbd{M-x
report-emacs-bug}.  Even more, and often useful, information can be
generated by redirecting the output of @code{make} and @code{make check}
to a file (@file{beta.err} is the default used by @code{build-report}),
and executing @kbd{M-x build-report}.

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.4.3: XEmacs crashes and I compiled it myself.

There have been a variety of reports of crashes due to compilers with
buggy optimizers.  If you are compiling with optimization, consider
turning it off (@pxref{Q2.4.4, How to debug an XEmacs problem with a
debugger}) and recompiling.

Please see the @file{PROBLEMS} file that comes with XEmacs (it's in
the top-level source directory) to read what it says about your
platform.

If you compiled XEmacs 21.4 or ealier using @samp{--use-union-type}, or
21.5 or later using @samp{--enable-union-type} (or in either case used
the option @samp{USE_UNION_TYPE} in @file{config.inc} under Windows),
try recompiling again without it.  The union type has been known to
trigger compiler errors in a number of cases.

@node Q2.4.4, Q2.4.5, Q2.4.3, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.4.4: How to debug an XEmacs problem with a debugger

If XEmacs does crash on you, one of the most productive things you can
do to help get the bug fixed is to poke around a bit with the debugger.
Here are some hints:

@itemize @bullet
@item
First of all, if the crash is at all reproducible, consider very
strongly recompiling your XEmacs with debugging symbols and with no
optimization (e.g. with GCC use the compiler flags @samp{-g -O0} --
that's an "oh" followed by a zero), and with the configure options
@samp{--debug=yes} and @samp{--error-checking=all}
(@samp{--enable-debug=yes} and @samp{--enable-error-checking=all} on
XEmacs 21.5 or later).  This will make your XEmacs run somewhat slower,
but you are a lot more likely to catch the problem earlier (closer to
its source).  It makes it a lot easier to determine what's going on with
a debugger.  The way to control the compiler flags is with the
configuration option @samp{--cflags} (@samp{--with-cflags} in 21.5).  If
you have a recent version of 21.5, you should use
@samp{--without-optimization} in preference to directly setting
@samp{--cflags}.

@item
If it's not a true crash (@emph{i.e.}, XEmacs is hung, or a zombie
process), or it's inconvenient to run XEmacs again because XEmacs is
already running or is running in batch mode as part of a bunch of
scripts, you may be able to attach to the existing process with your
debugger.  Under Unix and Mac OS X, the typical way to do this is to
first use some variant of the @samp{ps} command to figure out the
process ID of XEmacs, for example @samp{ps -auxww | grep xemacs} under
a BSD variant, @samp{ps -elf | grep xemacs} under Linux or System V,
or @samp{ps -aW | grep xemacs} under Cygwin.  Then run

@example
gdb /path/to/xemacs/xemacs ####
@end example

Where @code{####} is the process id of your XEmacs. (If you're not
sure, try using @samp{which xemacs}.) When gdb attaches, the xemacs
will stop and you can type @samp{where} in gdb to get a stack trace as
usual.  To get things moving again, you can just type @samp{quit} in
gdb.  It'll tell you the program is running and ask if you want to
quit anyways.  Say @samp{y} and it'll quit and have your emacs
continue from where it was at.

If you're running another debugger, a similar method may work, or you
may have to run the debugger first and then use the @code{attach}
command or something similar.

Under Microsoft Windows, use the menu item @samp{Build->Start
Debug->Attach to Process...} and select the XEmacs process from the list
given.

@item
If you're able to run XEmacs under a debugger and reproduce the crash,
here are some things you can do:

@item
If XEmacs is hitting an assertion failure, put a breakpoint on
@code{assert_failed()}.

@item
If XEmacs is hitting some weird Lisp error that's causing it to crash
(e.g. during startup), put a breakpoint on @code{signal_1()}---this is
declared static in @file{eval.c}.

@item
If XEmacs is outputting lots of X errors, put a breakpoint on
@code{x_error_handler()}; that will tell you which call is causing
them.  Note that the result may not be very useful by default because
X Windows normally operates asynchronously: A bunch of commands are
buffered up and then sent to the server all at once.  This greatly
improves performance over a network but means that an error may not be
reported until the server receives the commands, which can be long
after XEmacs made the erroneous calls.  For best results, you need to
make the X server synchronous before getting the backtrace.  This can
be done by starting XEmacs with the @samp{-sync} option or executing
the Lisp code @code{(x-debug-mode t)}.

@item
Internally, you will probably see lots of variables that hold objects of
type @code{Lisp_Object}.  These are references to Lisp objects.
Printing them out with the debugger probably won't be too
useful---you'll likely just see a number.  To decode them, do this:

@example
call debug_print (OBJECT)
@end example

where @var{OBJECT} is whatever you want to decode (it can be a variable,
a function call, etc.).  This uses the Lisp printing routines to out a
readable representation on the TTY from which the xemacs process was
invoked.

Under 21.5 and later, @code{dp} is defined as an easier-to-type equivalent
of @code{debug_print}.  You can also try @code{dpa} if you can't see
the output from @code{debug_print} (this will return a string containing
the output), or use @code{debug_p3} if @code{debug_print} itself triggers
a crash (this is a less comprehensive but super-safe way to print out
a Lisp object).

@item
If you want to get a Lisp backtrace showing the Lisp call
stack, do this:

@example
call debug_backtrace ()
@end example

Under 21.5 and later, @code{db} is defined as an easier-to-type equivalent
of @code{debug_backtrace}.

@item
Using @code{debug_print} and @code{debug_backtrace} has two
disadvantages - they can only be used with a running (including hung
or zombie) xemacs process, and they do not display the internal C
structure of a Lisp Object.  Even if all you've got is a core dump,
all is not lost.

If you're using GDB, there are some macros in the file
@file{src/.gdbinit} in the XEmacs source distribution that should make
it easier for you to decode Lisp objects.  This file is automatically
read by gdb if gdb is run in the directory where xemacs was built, and
contains these useful macros to inspect the state of xemacs:

@table @code
@item pobj
Usage: pobj lisp_object @*
Print the internal C representation of a lisp object.

@item xtype
Usage: xtype lisp_object @*
Print the Lisp type of a lisp object.

@item lbt
Usage: lbt @*
Print the current Lisp stack trace.
Requires a running xemacs process.  (It works by calling the db
routine described above.)

@item ldp
Usage: ldp lisp_object @*
Print a Lisp Object value using the Lisp printer.
Requires a running xemacs process.  (It works by calling the dp
routine described above.)

@item run-temacs
Usage: run-temacs @*
Run temacs interactively, like xemacs.
Use this with debugging tools (like purify) that cannot deal with dumping,
or when temacs builds successfully, but xemacs does not.

@item dump-temacs
Usage: dump-temacs @*
Run the dumping part of the build procedure.
Use when debugging temacs, not xemacs!
Use this when temacs builds successfully, but xemacs does not.

@item check-xemacs
Usage: check-xemacs @*
Run the test suite.  Equivalent to 'make check'.

@item check-temacs
Usage: check-temacs @*
Run the test suite on temacs.  Equivalent to 'make check-temacs'.
Use this with debugging tools (like purify) that cannot deal with dumping,
or when temacs builds successfully, but xemacs does not.
@end table

If you are using Sun's @file{dbx} debugger, there is an equivalent file
@file{src/.dbxrc}, which defines the same commands for dbx.

@item
If you're using a debugger to get a C stack backtrace and you're seeing
stack traces with some of the innermost frames mangled, it may be due to
dynamic linking. (This happens especially under Linux.) Consider
reconfiguring with @samp{--dynamic=no} (@samp{--with-dynamic=no} in 21.5
or later).  Also, sometimes (again under Linux), stack backtraces of
core dumps will have the frame where the fatal signal occurred mangled;
if you can obtain a stack trace while running the XEmacs process under a
debugger, the stack trace should be clean.

@email{1CMC3466@@ibm.mtsac.edu, Curtiss} suggests upgrading to ld.so
version 1.8 if dynamic linking and debugging is a problem on Linux.

@item
If you're using a debugger to get a C stack backtrace and you're
getting a completely mangled and bogus stack trace, it's probably due to
one of the following:

@enumerate a
@item
Your executable has been stripped.  Bad news.  Tell your sysadmin not to
do this---it doesn't accomplish anything except to save a bit of disk
space, and makes debugging much much harder.

@item
Your stack is getting trashed.  Debugging this is hard; you have to do a
binary-search type of narrowing down where the crash occurs, until you
figure out exactly which line is causing the problem.  Of course, this
only works if the bug is highly reproducible.  Also, in many cases if
you run XEmacs from the debugger, the debugger can protect the stack
somewhat.  However, if the stack is being smashed, it is typically the
case that there is a wild pointer somewhere in the program, often quite
far from where the crash occurs.

@item
If your stack trace has exactly one frame in it, with address 0x0, this
could simply mean that XEmacs attempted to execute code at that address,
e.g. through jumping to a null function pointer.  Unfortunately, under
those circumstances, GDB under Linux doesn't know how to get a stack
trace. (Yes, this is the fourth Linux-related problem I've mentioned.  I
have no idea why GDB under Linux is so bogus.  Complain to the GDB
authors, or to comp.os.linux.development.system.) Again, you'll have to
use the narrowing-down process described above.

@item
You will get a Lisp backtrace output when XEmacs crashes, so you'll have
something useful.

@end enumerate

@item
If you compile with the newer gcc variants gcc-2.8 or egcs, you will
also need gdb 4.17 or above.  Earlier releases of gdb can't handle the
debug information generated by the newer compilers.

@item
In versions of XEmacs before 21.2.27, @file{src/.gdbinit} was named
@file{src/gdbinit}.  This had the disadvantage of not being sourced
automatically by gdb, so you had to set that up yourself.

@item

get a cryptic error message in the minibuffer.

If the message went by too quickly, use @samp{Help->Recent Messages}

If you can't figure out what's going on, select
@samp{Options->Troubleshooting->Debug on Error} from the menubar (or
type @kbd{M-:} then @kbd{(setq debug-on-error t)}) then try and make

reading through this FAQ; if that fails, you could try posting to
@samp{comp.emacs.xemacs} (making sure to include the backtrace) and
someone may be able to help.  If you can identify which XEmacs Lisp

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.4.6: XEmacs hangs when I try to do something.

XEmacs might just be slow; some operations take a long time.  XEmacs
may also be waiting on a response from the network, for example when
you are trying to send mail.

You can usually interrupt XEmacs by typing @kbd{C-g}.  If not (for
example, Lisp code explicitly disabled this by setting
@code{inhibit-quit}), you can use the "critical quit" mechanism by
typing @kbd{Control-Shift-G}.  This should also pop you into the
debugger and give you a backtrace, which can tell you where the
problem is (@pxref{Q2.4.4, How to debug an XEmacs problem with a
debugger}). (Note that setting @code{debug-on-quit} or selecting
@samp{Options->Troubleshooting->Debug on Quit} will also cause regular
@kbd{C-g} to enter the debugger and give you a backtrace.)

If you can't interrupt XEmacs this way, or for some reason XEmacs is
not talking to the keyboard, you can try sending the @samp{SIGINT}
signal using the @samp{kill} command.

If the Lisp backtrace isn't enlightening, or if XEmacs is so hung that
you can't interrupt it at all, you could try attaching to the process
and getting a C stack backtrace.  @xref{Q2.4.4, How to debug an XEmacs
problem with a debugger}.

@node Q2.4.7, Q2.4.8, Q2.4.6, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.4.7: I get an error message when XEmacs is running in batch mode.

Typically this happens when you are trying to compile some Elisp code.
If you are doing this as part of XEmacs or the XEmacs packages, you
should automatically get a backtrace, which can help you determine the
source of the problem.  In other cases, you can get equivalent results
by setting the environment variable @samp{XEMACSDEBUG} to @samp{(setq
stack-trace-on-error t load-always-display-messages t
load-ignore-out-of-date-elc-files t load-show-full-path-in-messages
t)} (this needs to be all on one line; to set an environment variable,
use @samp{export XEMACSDEBUG='FOO'} under @samp{bash}, @samp{zsh},
etc. or @samp{setenv XEMACSDEBUG 'FOO'} under @samp{csh} and
@samp{tcsh}).  @samp{XEMACSDEBUG} specifies Lisp code that will be
executed at startup time.

If the backtrace is not sufficiently useful in helping you diagnose
the problem, you should consider using a debugger such as GDB.
@xref{Q2.4.4, How to debug an XEmacs problem with a debugger}.  You
probably want to set a breakpoint on @code{signal_1}.  Since such
errors often occur during compiling, which is often triggered by a
complex command run from a make suite, it may be easier to attach to
the process once it's running.

Under Microsoft Windows (and perhaps other operating systems), there is
another useful trick you can do if you have configured with debugging
support (configure option @samp{--debug} (@samp{--with-debug} in 21.5)
or setting @samp{DEBUG_XEMACS} in @file{nt/config.inc}).  Set the
environment variable @samp{XEMACSDEBUG} (as described above) to
@samp{(setq debug-on-error t)}.  Then, when an error occurs
noninteractively, instead of trying to invoke the Lisp debugger (which
obviously won't work), XEmacs will break out to a C debugger using
@code{(force-debugging-signal t)}.  @emph{NOTE}: This runs
@code{abort()}!!! (As well as and after executing INT 3 under MS
Windows, which should invoke a debugger if it's active.) This is
guaranteed to kill XEmacs! (But in this situation, XEmacs is about to
die anyway, and if no debugger is present, this will usefully dump
core.)

@node Q2.4.8, Q2.4.9, Q2.4.7, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.4.8: The keyboard or mouse is not working properly, or I have some other event-related problem.

XEmacs has various facilities for debugging event handling.

First, try setting the variable @code{debug-emacs-events} to non-zero.
This will output various information showing which events are being
received and how they are being translated.  This may show you, for
example, that a key command is getting intercepted using
@code{key-translation-map}; this problem can otherwise be very tricky
to debug.

Under X, you can see exactly which events are being received from the
window system by setting @code{x-debug-events} to non-zero. (The value
@samp{1} gives you regular output, and @samp{2} gives you verbose
output, including all parameters.)

A similar facility exists under MS Windows: Set
@code{debug-mswindows-events} to non-zero. (The value @samp{1} gives
you regular output.  The value @samp{2} gives you verbose output,
including all parameters.  The value @samp{3} gives you
super-gorily-detailed output.)

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.4.9: @kbd{C-g} doesn't work for me.  Is it broken?

@kbd{C-g} does work for most people in most circumstances.  If it
doesn't, there are two possible explanations:

@enumerate
@item
XEmacs is hung in a way that prevents @kbd{C-g} from working.  This
can happen when code is wrapped with a binding of @code{inhibit-quit}
to @code{t}; you should still be able interrupt XEmacs using "critical
quit".  On the other hand, XEmacs may be seriously wedged. (If you're
lucky, sending @samp{SIGINT} to the XEmacs process will interrupt it.) 
@xref{Q2.4.6, XEmacs hangs when I try to do something.}.

@item
@kbd{C-g} is indeed broken on your system.  To test, try executing
@code{(while t)} from the @samp{*scratch*} buffer.  If @kbd{C-g}
doesn't interrupt, then it's broken.  This used to happen with systems
where @samp{SIGIO} was broken, but @samp{BROKEN_SIGIO} wasn't defined.
However, there may not be very many such systems nowadays.

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.4.10: How do I debug process-related problems?

Under MS Windows, you can set the variable
@code{debug-mswindows-process-command-lines} to non-@samp{nil} to get
information on exactly what is getting passed to a process.  This can
be useful in determining problems with quoting. (Under Unix, a process
receives each argument separately, but under MS Windows a single
command line is received, and arguments with spaces or other special
characters in them must be quoted.  Unfortunately this means that each
process, potentially at least, has its own quoting conventions, and
the code to process quoting conventions in @file{cmd.exe}, the Visual
C++ startup code and the like is baroque and poorly documented.
XEmacs uses the variable
@code{mswindows-construct-process-command-line-alist} to construct a
command line from a list of arguments based on the command to be run,
but it is (and cannot be) a perfect solution.)

If something is still going wrong, or you get a startup warning about

on the path-searching process at startup by setting the environment
variable @samp{EMACSDEBUGPATHS} to a non-null value.  One thing to
look for if you're having package problems is the value of
@samp{configure-package-path}.  This corresponds to what was compiled
into XEmacs using the @samp{--package-prefix} or @samp{--package-path}

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.5.6: XEmacs 21.1 on Windows used to spawn an ugly console window on every startup.  Has that been fixed?

Yes.

The console was there because @file{temacs} (and in turn, @file{xemacs})
was a console application, and Windows typically creates a new
console for a console process unless the creating process requests that
one isn't created.  This used to be fixed with @file{runemacs}, a small
Windows application that existed merely to start @file{xemacs}, stating
that it didn't want a console.

XEmacs 21.4 fixes this cleanly by the virtue of being a true "GUI"
application.  The explanation of what that means is included for
educational value.

When building an application to be run in a Win32 environment, you must
state which sub-system it is to run in.  Valid subsystems include
"console" and "gui".  The subsystem you use affects the run time
libraries linked into your application, the start up function that is
run before control is handed over to your application, the entry point
to your program, and how Windows normally invokes your program. (Console
programs automatically get a console created for them at startup if
their stdin/stdout don't point anywhere useful, which is the case when
run from the GUI.  This is a stupid design, of course -- instead, the
console should get created only when the first I/O actually occurs!
GUI programs have an equally stupid design: When called from
@file{CMD.EXE}/@file{COMMAND.COM}, their stdin/stdout will be set to
point nowhere useful, even though the command shell has its own
stdin/stdout.  It's as if someone who had learned a bit about stdio but
had no actual knowledge of interprocess communication designed the
scheme; unfortunately, the whole process-communication aspect of the
Win32 API is equally badly designed.) For example, the entry point for a
console app is "main" (which is what you'd expect for a C/C++ program),
but the entry point for a "gui" app is "WinMain".  This confuses and
annoys a lot of programmers who've grown up on Unix systems, where the
kernel doesn't really care whether your application is a gui program or
not.

For reasons not altogether clear, and are lost in the mists of time and
tradition, XEmacs on Win32 started out as a console application, and
therefore a console was automatically created for it. (It may have been
made a console application partly because a console is needed in some
circumstances, especially under Win95, to interrupt, terminate, or send
signals to a child process, and because of the bogosity mentioned above
with GUI programs and the standard command shell.  Currently, XEmacs
just creates and immediately hides a console when necessary, and
works around the "no useful stdio" problem by creating its own console
window as necessary to display messages in.)

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.2: How can I bind complex functions (or macros) to keys?

As an example, say you want the @kbd{paste} key on a Sun keyboard to
insert the current Primary X selection at point. You can accomplish this
with:

@lisp
(define-key global-map [f18] 'x-insert-selection)
@end lisp

However, this only works if there is a current X selection (the
selection will be highlighted).  The functionality I like is for the
@kbd{paste} key to insert the current X selection if there is one,
otherwise insert the contents of the clipboard.  To do this you need to
pass arguments to @code{x-insert-selection}.  This is done by wrapping
the call in a 'lambda form:

@lisp
(global-set-key [f18]
  (lambda () (interactive) (x-insert-selection t nil)))
@end lisp

This binds the f18 key to a @dfn{generic} functional object.  The
interactive spec is required because only interactive functions can be
bound to keys.

For the FAQ example you could use:

@lisp
(global-set-key [(control ?.)]
  (lambda () (interactive) (scroll-up 1)))
(global-set-key [(control ?;)]
  (lambda () (interactive) (scroll-up -1)))
@end lisp

This is fine if you only need a few functions within the lambda body.
If you're doing more it's cleaner to define a separate function.
@xref{Q3.0.3, How do I bind C-. and C-; to scroll one line up and
down?}.

@node Q3.0.3, Q3.0.4, Q3.0.2, Editing
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.3: How do I bind C-. and C-; to scroll one line up and down?

Add the following (Thanks to @email{mly@@adoc.xerox.com, Richard Mlynarik} and
@email{wayne@@zen.cac.stratus.com, Wayne Newberry}) to @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(defun scroll-up-one-line ()
  (interactive)
  (scroll-up 1))

(defun scroll-down-one-line ()
  (interactive)
  (scroll-down 1))

(global-set-key [(control ?.)] 'scroll-up-one-line) ; C-.
(global-set-key [(control ?;)] 'scroll-down-one-line) ; C-;
@end lisp

The key point is that you can only bind simple functions to keys; you
can not bind a key to a function that you're also passing arguments
to.  (@pxref{Q3.0.2, How can I bind complex functions (or macros) to
keys?} for a better answer).

@node Q3.0.4, Q3.0.5, Q3.0.3, Editing
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.4: Globally binding @kbd{Delete}?

I cannot manage to globally bind my @kbd{Delete} key to something other
than the default.  How does one do this?

Answer: The problem is that many modes explicitly bind @kbd{Delete}.  To
get around this, try the following:

@lisp
(defun foo ()
  (interactive)
  (message "You hit DELETE"))

(define-key key-translation-map 'delete 'redirected-delete)
(global-set-key 'redirected-delete 'foo)
@end lisp

@node Q3.0.5, Q3.0.6, Q3.0.4, Editing
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.5: How to map @kbd{Help} key alone on Sun type4 keyboard?

The following works in GNU Emacs 19:

@lisp
(global-set-key [help] 'help-command);; Help
@end lisp

The following works in XEmacs with the addition of shift:

@lisp
(global-set-key [(shift help)] 'help-command);; Help
@end lisp

But it doesn't work alone.  This is in the file @file{PROBLEMS} which
should have come with your XEmacs installation: @emph{Emacs ignores the
@kbd{help} key when running OLWM}.

OLWM grabs the @kbd{help} key, and retransmits it to the appropriate
client using
@iftex
@*
@end iftex
@code{XSendEvent}.  Allowing Emacs to react to synthetic
events is a security hole, so this is turned off by default.  You can
enable it by setting the variable @code{x-allow-sendevents} to t.  You
can also cause fix this by telling OLWM to not grab the help key, with
the null binding @code{OpenWindows.KeyboardCommand.Help:}.

@node Q3.0.6, Q3.0.7, Q3.0.5, Editing
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.6: How can you type in special characters in XEmacs?
One way is to use the package @code{x-compose}.  Then you can use
sequences like @kbd{Compose " a} to get , etc.

Another way is to use the @code{iso-insert} package. Then you can use
sequences like @kbd{C-x 8 " a} to get , etc.

@email{glynn@@sensei.co.uk, Glynn Clements} writes:

@quotation
It depends upon your X server.

Generally, the simplest way is to define a key as Multi_key with
xmodmap, e.g.
@c hey, show some respect, willya -- there's xkeycaps, isn't there? --
@c chr ;)
@example
        xmodmap -e 'keycode 0xff20 = Multi_key'
@end example

You will need to pick an appropriate keycode. Use xev to find out the
keycodes for each key.

[NB: On a `Windows' keyboard, recent versions of XFree86 automatically
define the right `Windows' key as Multi_key'.]

Once you have Multi_key defined, you can use e.g.
@example
        Multi a '       => 
        Multi e "       => 
        Multi c ,       => 
@end example

etc.

Also, recent versions of XFree86 define various AltGr-<key>
combinations as dead keys, i.e.
@example
        AltGr [         => dead_diaeresis
        AltGr ]         => dead_tilde
        AltGr ;         => dead_acute
@end example
etc.

Running @samp{xmodmap -pk} will list all of the defined keysyms.

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.7: Can I turn on @dfn{sticky} modifier keys?

Yes, with @code{(setq modifier-keys-are-sticky t)}.  This will give the
effect of being able to press and release Shift and have the next
character typed come out in upper case.  This will affect all the other
modifier keys like Control and Meta as well.

One thing about the sticky modifiers is that if you move the mouse out
of the frame and back in, it cancels all currently ``stuck'' modifiers.

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.10: Why does edt emulation not work?

We don't know, but you can use tpu-edt emulation instead, which works
fine and is a little fancier than the standard edt emulation.  To do
this, add the following line to your @file{init.el}:

@lisp
(tpu-edt)
@end lisp

If you don't want it to replace @kbd{C-h} with an edt-style help menu
add this as well:

Our recommended VI emulator is viper. To make viper-mode the default,

@node Q3.1.1, Q3.1.2, Q3.0.11, Editing
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.1.1: How can I turn off Mouse pasting?

I keep hitting the middle mouse button by accident and getting stuff
pasted into my buffer so how can I turn this off?

Here is an alternative binding, whereby the middle mouse button selects
(but does not cut) the expression under the mouse. Clicking middle on a
left or right paren will select to the matching one.  Note that you can
use @code{define-key} or @code{global-set-key}.

@lisp
(defun mouse-set-point-and-select (event)
  "Sets the point at the mouse location, then marks following form"
  (interactive "@@e")

@end lisp

@node Q3.1.2, Q3.1.3, Q3.1.1, Editing
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.1.2: How do I set control/meta/etc modifiers on mouse buttons?

Use, for instance, @code{[(meta button1)]}. For example, here is a common
setting for Common Lisp programmers who use the bundled @code{ilisp}
package, whereby meta-button1 on a function name will find the file where
the function name was defined, and put you at that location in the source
file.

[Inside a function that gets called by the lisp-mode-hook and
ilisp-mode-hook]

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.1.5: How can I set XEmacs up so that it pastes where the text cursor is?

By default XEmacs pastes X selections where the mouse pointer is.  How
do I disable this?

Examine the function @code{mouse-yank}, by typing @kbd{C-h f mouse-yank
@key{RET}}.

To get XEmacs to paste at the text cursor, add this your @file{init.el}:

@lisp
(setq mouse-yank-at-point t)
@end lisp

You can also change this with Customize.  Select from the
@code{Options} menu @code{Advanced

@node Q3.2.1, Q3.2.2, Q3.1.5, Editing
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.2.1: Can I have the end of the buffer delimited in some way?

Say, with: @samp{[END]}?

Try this:

@lisp
(let ((ext (make-extent (point-min) (point-max))))
  (set-extent-property ext 'start-closed t)
  (set-extent-property ext 'end-closed t)
  (set-extent-property ext 'detachable nil)
  (set-extent-end-glyph ext (make-glyph [string :data "[END]"])))
@end lisp

Since this is XEmacs, you can specify an icon to be shown on
window-system devices.  To do so, change the @code{make-glyph} call to
something like this:

@lisp
(make-glyph '([xpm :file "~/something.xpm"]
              [string :data "[END]"]))
@end lisp

You can inline the @sc{xpm} definition yourself by specifying
@code{:data} instead of @code{:file}.  Here is such a full-featured
version that works on both X and TTY devices:

@lisp
(let ((ext (make-extent (point-min) (point-max))))
  (set-extent-property ext 'start-closed t)
  (set-extent-property ext 'end-closed t)
  (set-extent-property ext 'detachable nil)

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.2.4: How can I enable auto-indent and/or Filladapt?

Put the following line in your @file{init.el}:

@lisp
(setq indent-line-function 'indent-relative-maybe)
@end lisp

If you want to get fancy, try the @code{filladapt} package available
standard with XEmacs.  Put this into your @file{init.el}:

@lisp
(require 'filladapt)
(setq-default filladapt-mode t)
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-off-filladapt-mode)
@end lisp

This will enable Filladapt for all modes except C mode, where it doesn't
work well.  To turn Filladapt on only in particular major modes, remove
the @code{(setq-default ...)} line and use
@code{turn-on-filladapt-mode}, like this:

@lisp
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-filladapt-mode)
@end lisp

You can customize filling and adaptive filling with Customize.
Select from the @code{Options} menu
@code{Advanced (Customize)->Emacs->Editing->Fill->Fill...}
or type @kbd{M-x customize @key{RET} fill @key{RET}}.

Note that well-behaving text-lookalike modes will run
@code{text-mode-hook} by default (e.g. that's what Message does).  For
the nasty ones, you'll have to provide the @code{add-hook}s yourself.

Please note that the @code{fa-extras} package is no longer useful.

@node Q3.2.5, Q3.3.1, Q3.2.4, Editing
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.2.5: How can I get XEmacs to come up in text/auto-fill mode by default?

Try the following lisp in your @file{init.el}:

@lisp
(setq default-major-mode 'text-mode)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
@end lisp

@strong{WARNING}: note that changing the value of
@code{default-major-mode} from @code{fundamental-mode} can break a large
amount of built-in code that expects newly created buffers to be in
@code{fundamental-mode}.  (Changing from @code{fundamental-mode} to
@code{text-mode} might not wreak too much havoc, but changing to
something more exotic like a lisp-mode would break many Emacs packages).

Note that Emacs by default starts up in buffer @code{*scratch*} in
@code{initial-major-mode}, which defaults to
@code{lisp-interaction-mode}. Thus adding the following form to your
Emacs init file will cause the initial @code{*scratch*} buffer to be put
into auto-fill'ed @code{text-mode}:

@lisp
(setq initial-major-mode
      (lambda ()
        (text-mode)
        (turn-on-auto-fill)))
@end lisp

Note that after your init file is loaded, if
@code{inhibit-startup-message} is @code{nil} (the default) and the
startup buffer is @code{*scratch*} then the startup message will be
inserted into @code{*scratch*}; it will be removed after a timeout by
erasing the entire @code{*scratch*} buffer.  Keep in mind this default
usage of @code{*scratch*} if you desire any prior manipulation of
@code{*scratch*} from within your Emacs init file. In particular,
anything you insert into @code{*scratch*} from your init file will be
later erased. Also, if you change the mode of the @code{*scratch*}
buffer, be sure that this will not interfere with possible later
insertion of the startup message (e.g. if you put @code{*scratch*} into
a nonstandard mode that has automatic font lock rules, then the startup
message might get fontified in a strange foreign manner, e.g. as code in
some programming language).

@node Q3.3.1, Q3.3.2, Q3.2.5, Editing
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.3.1: How do I select a rectangular region?

Just select the region normally, then use the rectangle commands (e.g.
@code{kill-rectangle} on it.  The region does not highlight as a
rectangle, but the commands work just fine.

To actually sweep out rectangular regions with the mouse you can use
@code{mouse-track-do-rectangle} which is assigned to @kbd{M-button1}.
Then use rectangle commands.

You can also do the following to change default behavior to sweep out
rectangular regions:

@lisp
(setq mouse-track-rectangle-p t)
@end lisp

You can also change this with Customize.
Select from the @code{Options} menu
@code{Advanced (Customize)->Emacs->Editing->Mouse->Track Rectangle...} or type
@kbd{M-x customize @key{RET} mouse @key{RET}}.


@example
 mouse-track-do-rectangle: (event)

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.3.2: How can I turn off or change highlighted selections?

The @code{zmacs} mode allows for what some might call gratuitous
highlighting for selected regions (either by setting mark or by using
the mouse).  This is the default behavior.  To turn off, add the
following line to your @file{init.el} file:

@lisp
(setq zmacs-regions nil)
@end lisp

You can also change this with Customize.  Select from the
@code{Options} menu
@code{Advanced (Customize)->Emacs->Editing->Basics->Zmacs Regions}
or type @kbd{M-x customize @key{RET} editing-basics @key{RET}}.

To change the face for selection, look at @code{Options->Advanced (Customize)}
on the menubar.

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.3.3: How do I cause typing on an active region to remove it?

I want to change things so that if I select some text and start typing,
the typed text replaces the selected text, similar to Motif.

You want to use something called @dfn{pending delete}.  Pending delete
is what happens when you select a region (with the mouse or keyboard)
and you press a key to replace the selected region by the key you typed.
Usually backspace kills the selected region.

To get this behavior, ensure that you have the @file{pc} package
installed, and add the following lines to your
@file{init.el}:

@lisp
(cond
 ((fboundp 'turn-on-pending-delete)
  (turn-on-pending-delete))
 ((fboundp 'pending-delete-on)
  (pending-delete-on t)))
@end lisp

Note that this will work with both Backspace and Delete.  This code is a
tad more complicated than it has to be for XEmacs in order to make it
more portable.

@end lisp

You can also change this with Customize. Type
@kbd{M-x customize-variable @key{RET} isearch-highlight @key{RET}}.

Note also that isearch-highlight affects query-replace and ispell.
Instead of disabling isearch-highlight you may find that a better
solution consists of customizing the @code{isearch} face.

a transient selection that gets replaced every time a new selection is made

@item Secondary selection
for "exchanging" with the primary selection

@item Cut buffers
a clipboard internal to the X server (deprecated)

@item Clipboard selection
a selection with a notification protocol that allows a separate app to
manage the clipboard
@end table

The cut buffers are deprecated because managing them is even more
inefficient than the clipboard notification protocol.  The primary
selection works fine for many users and applications, but is not very
robust under intensive or sophisticated use.

In Motif and MS Windows, a clipboard has become the primary means for
managing cut and paste.  These means that "modern" applications tend to
be oriented toward a true clipboard, rather than the primary selection.
(On Windows, there is nothing equivalent to the primary selection.)
It's not that XEmacs doesn't support the simple primary selection
method, it's that more and more other applications don't.

So the slowdown occurs because XEmacs now engages in the clipboard
notification protocol on @emph{every} kill.  This is especially slow on
Motif.

With most people running most clients and server on the same host, and
many of the rest working over very fast communication, you may expect
that the situation is not going to improve.

There are a number of workarounds.  The most effective is to use a
special command to do selection ownership only when you intend to paste
to another application.  Useful commands are @code{kill-primary-selection}
and @code{copy-primary-selection}.  These work only on text selected
with the mouse (probably; experiment), and are bound by default to the
@kbd{Cut} and @kbd{Copy}, respectively, buttons on the toolbar.
@code{copy-primary-selection} is also bound to @kbd{C-Insert}.  You can
yank the clipboard contents with @code{yank-primary-selection}, bound to
the @kbd{Paste} toolbar button and @kbd{Sh-Insert}.

If you are communicating by cut and paste with applications that use the
primary selection, then you can customize
@code{interprogram-cut-function} to @code{nil}, restoring the XEmacs
version 20 behavior.  How can you tell if a program will support this?
Motifly-correct programs require the clipboard; you lose.  For others,
only by trying it.  You also need to customize the complementary
@code{interprogram-paste-function} to @code{nil}.  (Otherwise
XEmacs-to-XEmacs pastes will not work correctly.)

You may get some relief on Motif by setting
@code{x-selection-strict-motif-ownership} to nil, but this means you will
only intermittently be able to paste XEmacs kills to Motif applications.

Thanks to Jeff Mincy and Glynn Clements for corrections.

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.3.6: Why does @kbd{M-w} take so long?

It actually doesn't.  It leaves the region visible for a second so that
you can see what area is being yanked.  If you start working, though, it
will immediately complete its operation.  In other words, it will only
delay for a second if you let it.

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.4.1: I do not like cc-mode.  How do I use the old c-mode?

Well, first off, consider if you really want to do this.  cc-mode is
much more powerful than the old c-mode.  If you're having trouble
getting your old offsets to work, try using @code{c-set-offset} instead.
You might also consider using the package @code{cc-compat}.

But, if you still insist, add the following lines to your @file{init.el}:

@lisp
(fmakunbound 'c-mode)
(makunbound 'c-mode-map)
(fmakunbound 'c++-mode)
(makunbound 'c++-mode-map)
(makunbound 'c-style-alist)

(load-library "old-c++-mode")

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.4.2: How do you make XEmacs indent CL if-clauses correctly?

I'd like XEmacs to indent all the clauses of a Common Lisp @code{if} the
same amount instead of indenting the 3rd clause differently from the
first two.

The package @code{cl-indent} that comes with XEmacs sets up this kind
of indentation by default.  @code{cl-indent} also knows about many
other CL-specific forms.  To use @code{cl-indent}, one can do this:

@lisp
(setq lisp-indent-function 'common-lisp-indent-function)
@end lisp

One can also customize @file{cl-indent.el} so it mimics the default
@code{if} indentation @code{then} indented more than the @code{else}.
Here's how:

@lisp
(put 'if 'common-lisp-indent-function '(nil nil &body))
@end lisp

@unnumberedsubsec Q4.0.1: How do I specify a font?

#### Update me.

In 21.4 and above, you can use the @samp{Options} menu to change the font.
You can also do it in your init file, e.g. like this (for MS Windows):

@display
    (set-face-font 'default "Lucida Console:Regular:10")
    (set-face-font 'modeline "MS Sans Serif:Regular:10")
@end display

@node Q4.0.2, Q4.0.3, Q4.0.1, Display
@unnumberedsubsec Q4.0.2: How do I set the text, menu and modeline fonts?

#### Update me.

Note that you should use @samp{Emacs.} and not @samp{Emacs*} when
setting face values.

In @file{.Xresources}:

@example
Emacs.default.attributeFont:  -*-*-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-m-*-*-*
Emacs*menubar*font:           fixed
Emacs.modeline.attributeFont: fixed
@end example

This is confusing because @samp{default} and @samp{modeline} are face
names, and can be found listed with all faces in the current mode by
using @kbd{M-x set-face-font (enter) ?}.  They use the face-specific
resource @samp{attributeFont}.

On the other hand, @samp{menubar} is a normal X thing that uses the
resource @samp{font}.  With Motif it @emph{may be} necessary to use
@samp{fontList} @emph{instead of} @samp{font}.  In @emph{non-Motif}
configurations with Mule it @emph{is} necessary to use @samp{fontSet}
instead of @samp{font}.  (Sorry, there just is no simple recipe here.)

@unnumberedsubsec Q4.0.5: How can I limit color map usage?

I'm using Netscape (or another color grabber like XEmacs);
is there any way to limit the number of available colors in the color map?

Answer: No, but you can start Netscape before XEmacs, and it will use
the closest available color if the colormap is full.  You can also limit
the number of colors Netscape uses, using the flags -mono, -ncols <#> or
-install (for mono, limiting to <#> colors, or for using a private color
map).

If you have the money, another solution would be to use a truecolor or
direct color video.

since each face can have its own pixmap background, a better way
would be to set a face's pixmap within your XEmacs init file, e.g.,

@unnumberedsubsec Q4.0.8: How do I display non-ASCII characters?
@c New

If you're using a Mule-enabled XEmacs, then display is automatic.  If
you're not seeing the characters you expect, either (1) you don't have
appropriate fonts available or (2) XEmacs did not correctly detect the
coding system (@pxref{Recognize Coding, , , xemacs}).  In case (1),
install fonts as is customary for your platform.  In case (2), you
need to tell XEmacs explicitly what coding systems you're using.
@ref{Specify Coding, , , xemacs}.

If your XEmacs is not Mule-enabled, and for some reason getting a
Mule-enabled XEmacs seems like the wrong thing to do, all is not lost.
You can arrange it by brute force.  In @file{event-Xt.c} (suppress the
urge to look in this file---play Doom instead, because you'll survive
longer), it is written:

@quotation
In a non-Mule world, a user can still have a multi-lingual editor, by
doing @code{(set-face-font "-*-iso8859-2" (current-buffer))} for all
their Latin-2 buffers, etc.

Then, when editing a Lisp file (i.e. when in Lisp mode), the modeline
colors change from the default set in your @file{init.el}.
The change will only be made in the buffer you just entered (which
contains the Lisp file you are editing) and will not affect the modeline
colors anywhere else.

Notes:

@itemize @bullet

@item The hook is the mode name plus @code{-hook}.  eg. c-mode-hook,
c++-mode-hook, emacs-lisp-mode-hook (used for your
@file{init.el} or a @file{xx.el} file),
lisp-interaction-mode-hook (the @samp{*scratch*} buffer),
text-mode-hook, etc.

@item
Be sure to use @code{add-hook}, not @code{(setq c-mode-hook xxxx)},
otherwise you will erase anything that anybody has already put on the
hook.

@item
You can also do @code{(set-face-font 'modeline @var{font})},
eg. @code{(set-face-font 'modeline "*bold-r-normal*140-100-100*"
(current-buffer))} if you wish the modeline font to vary based on the
current mode.

There are additional modeline faces, @code{modeline-buffer-id},
@code{modeline-mousable}, and @code{modeline-mousable-minor-mode}, which

I am trying to use a resource like @code{Emacs*menubar*font} to set the
font of the menubar but it's not working.

In Motif, the use of @samp{font} resources is obsoleted in order to
support internationalization.  If you are using the real Motif menubar,
this resource is not recognized at all; you have to say:

@example
Emacs*menubar*fontList: FONT
@end example

If you are using the Lucid menubar, for backward compatibility with
existing user configurations, the @samp{font} resource is recognized.
Since this is not supported by Motif itself, the code is a kludge and
the @samp{font} resource will be recognized only if the @samp{fontList}
resource resource is unset.  This means that the resource

@example
*fontList: FONT
@end example

will override

@example
Emacs*menubar*font: FONT
@end example

even though the latter is more specific.

In non-Motif configurations using @samp{--with-mule} and
@samp{--with-xfs} it @emph{is} necessary to use the @code{fontSet}
resource @emph{instead of} the @code{font} resource.  The backward
compatibility kludge was never implemented for non-Motif builds.

@unnumberedsec 4.6: Scrollbars and Scrolling

@node Q4.6.1, Q4.6.2, Q4.5.4, Display
@unnumberedsubsec Q4.6.1: How can I disable the scrollbar?

To disable them for all frames, add the following line to
your @file{.Xresources}:

@example
Emacs.scrollBarWidth:  0
@end example

Or select @samp{Options->Display->Scrollbars}.
Remember to save options.

To turn the scrollbar off on a per-frame basis, use the following
function:

@lisp
(set-specifier scrollbar-width 0 (selected-frame))
@end lisp

You can actually turn the scrollbars on at any level you want by
substituting for (selected-frame) in the above command.  For example, to
turn the scrollbars off only in a single buffer:

@lisp
(set-specifier scrollbar-width 0 (current-buffer))
@end lisp

@unnumberedsubsec Q4.6.4: Moving the scrollbar can move the point; can I disable this?

When I move the scrollbar in an XEmacs window, it moves the point as
well, which should not be the default behavior.  Is this a bug or a
feature?  Can I disable it?

The current behavior is a feature, not a bug.  Point remains at the same
buffer position as long as that position does not scroll off the screen.
In that event, point will end up in either the upper-left or lower-left
hand corner.

This cannot be changed.

@unnumberedsubsec Q4.6.5: Scrolling one line at a time.

Can the cursor keys scroll the screen a line at a time, rather than the
default half page jump?  I tend it to find it disorienting.

Use the following:

@lisp
(setq scroll-step 1)
@end lisp

You can also change this with Customize.  Select from the
@code{Options} menu
@code{Advanced (Customize)->Emacs->Environment->Windows->Scroll Step...}
or type @kbd{M-x customize @key{RET} windows @key{RET}}.

@node Q4.6.6, Q4.6.7, Q4.6.5, Display
@unnumberedsubsec Q4.6.6: How can I turn off automatic horizontal scrolling in specific modes?

Do @code{(setq truncate-lines t)} in the mode-hooks for any modes
in which you want lines truncated.

More precisely: If @code{truncate-lines} is nil, horizontal scrollbars
will never appear.  Otherwise, they will appear only if the value of
@code{scrollbar-height} for that buffer/window/etc. is non-zero.  If you
do

@lisp
(set-specifier scrollbar-height 0)
@end lisp

then horizontal scrollbars will not appear in truncated buffers unless
the package specifically asked for them.

enabled by default.  To turn it off, put the following in your
@file{init.el}:

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.0.1: Where is a list of X resources?

Search through the @file{NEWS} file for @samp{X Resources}.  A fairly
comprehensive list is given after it.

In addition, an @file{app-defaults} file @file{etc/Emacs.ad} is
supplied, listing the defaults.  The file @file{etc/sample.Xresources}
gives a different set of defaults that you might consider for
installation in your @file{~/.Xresources} file.  It is nearly the same
as @file{etc/Emacs.ad}, but a few entries are altered.  Be careful about
installing the contents of this file into your @file{.Xresources} (or
legacy @file{.Xdefaults}) file if you use GNU Emacs under X11 as well.

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.0.3: How can I get the icon to just say @samp{XEmacs}?

I'd like the icon to just say @samp{XEmacs}, and not include the name of

Add the following line to your @file{init.el}:

@lisp
(setq frame-icon-title-format "XEmacs")
@end lisp

@node Q5.0.4, Q5.0.5, Q5.0.3, External Subsystems
@unnumberedsubsec Q5.0.4: How can I have the window title area display the full path?

I'd like to have the window title area display the full directory/name
of the current buffer file and not just the name.

Add the following line to your @file{init.el}:

@lisp
(setq frame-title-format "%S: %f")
@end lisp

A more sophisticated title might be:

@lisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '("%S: " (buffer-file-name "%f"
                                 (dired-directory dired-directory "%b"))))
@end lisp

That is, use the file name, or the dired-directory, or the buffer name.

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.0.5: @samp{xemacs -name junk} doesn't work?

When I run @samp{xterm -name junk}, I get an xterm whose class name
according to xprop, is @samp{junk}.  This is the way it's supposed to
work, I think.  When I run @samp{xemacs -name junk} the class name is
not set to @samp{junk}.  It's still @samp{emacs}.  What does
@samp{xemacs -name} really do?  The reason I ask is that my window
manager (fvwm) will make a window sticky and I use XEmacs to read my
mail.  I want that XEmacs window to be sticky, without having to use the
window manager's function to set the window sticky.  What gives?

@samp{xemacs -name} sets the application name for the program (that is,
the thing which normally comes from @samp{argv[0]}).  Using @samp{-name}
is the same as making a copy of the executable with that new name.  The
@code{WM_CLASS} property on each frame is set to the frame-name, and the
application-class.  So, if you did @samp{xemacs -name FOO} and then
created a frame named @var{BAR}, you'd get an X window with WM_CLASS =
@code{( "BAR", "Emacs")}.  However, the resource hierarchy for this
widget would be:

@example
Name:    FOO   .shell             .container   .BAR
Class:   Emacs .TopLevelEmacsShell.EmacsManager.EmacsFrame
@end example

instead of the default

@example
Name:    xemacs.shell             .container   .emacs
Class:   Emacs .TopLevelEmacsShell.EmacsManager.EmacsFrame
@end example


It is arguable that the first element of WM_CLASS should be set to the
application-name instead of the frame-name, but I think that's less
flexible, since it does not give you the ability to have multiple frames
with different WM_CLASS properties.  Another possibility would be for
the default frame name to come from the application name instead of
simply being @samp{emacs}.  However, at this point, making that change
would be troublesome: it would mean that many users would have to make
yet another change to their resource files (since the default frame name
would suddenly change from @samp{emacs} to @samp{xemacs}, or whatever
the executable happened to be named), so we'd rather avoid it.

To make a frame with a particular name use:

@lisp
(make-frame '((name . "the-name")))

@node Q5.1.1, Q5.1.2, Q5.0.6, External Subsystems
@unnumberedsubsec Q5.1.1: Does XEmacs rename all the @samp{win32-*} symbols to @samp{w32-*}?

In his flavor of Emacs 20, Richard Stallman has renamed all the @samp{win32-*}
symbols to @samp{w32-*}.  Does XEmacs do the same?

We consider such a move counter-productive, thus we do not use the
@samp{w32} prefix. (His rather questionable justification was that he
did not consider Windows to be a "winning" platform.) However, the name
@samp{Win32} is not particularly descriptive outside the Windows world,
and using just @samp{windows-} would be too generic.  So we chose a
compromise, the prefix @samp{mswindows-} for Windows-related variables
and functions.

Thus all the XEmacs variables and functions directly related to either
the Windows GUI or OS are prefixed @samp{mswindows-} (except for a
couple of debugging variables, prefixed @samp{debug-mswindows-}).  From
an architectural perspective, however, we believe that this is mostly a
non-issue because there should be a very small number of
window-systems-specific variables anyway.  Whenever possible, we try to
provide generic interfaces that apply to all window systems.

@c not true:
@c The user variables
@c that share functionality with existing NT Emacs variables are be named
@c with our convention, but we provide the GNU Emacs names as
@c compatibility aliases.

@node Q5.2.1, Q5.2.2, Q5.1.2, External Subsystems
@unnumberedsubsec Q5.2.1: What do I need to change to make printing work?

For regular printing there are two variables that can be customized.

@table @code
@item lpr-command
This should be set to a command that takes standard input and sends
it to a printer.  Something like:

@lisp
(setq lpr-command "lp")
@end lisp

@item lpr-switches
This should be set to a list that contains whatever the print command
requires to do its job.  Something like:

@lisp
(setq lpr-switches '("-depson"))
@end lisp
@end table

For postscript printing there are three analogous variables to
customize.

@table @code
@item ps-lpr-command
This should be set to a command that takes postscript on standard input
and directs it to a postscript printer.

@item ps-lpr-switches
This should be set to a list of switches required for
@code{ps-lpr-command} to do its job.

@item ps-print-color-p
This boolean variable should be set @code{t} if printing will be done in
color, otherwise it should be set to @code{nil}.
@end table

NOTE: It is an undocumented limitation in XEmacs that postscript
printing (the @code{Pretty Print Buffer} menu item) @strong{requires} a
window system environment.  It cannot be used outside of X11.

@item
Download the @file{rebase} utility from Cygwin setup (it's under
@samp{System}).
@item
Kill @strong{all} of your Cygwin processes, including all of your
shells and all background processes.  Use @code{ps -a} to list all the
processes you need to kill.
@item
From a DOS prompt, run @file{ash} (@strong{not} @file{bash},
@file{tcsh} or @file{zsh}).  Do not try to be clever and @code{exec
/bin/ash} from your last shell; it won't work.
@item
Type @code{/bin/rebaseall -v}.
@end enumerate

The problem should now be fixed -- at least, until you install another
Cygwin package with DLL's, in which case you may have to repeat the
procedure.

@node Q5.5.1, Q5.5.2, Q5.4.6, External Subsystems
@unnumberedsubsec Q5.5.1: How do I open a frame on another screen of my multi-headed display?

Use the command @kbd{M-x make-frame-on-display}.  This command is also
on the File menu in the menubar.

The command @code{make-frame-on-tty} also exists, which will establish a
connection to any tty-like device.  Opening the TTY devices should be
left to @code{gnuclient}, though.

@node Q5.5.3, Q5.5.4, Q5.5.2, External Subsystems
@unnumberedsubsec Q5.5.3: How do I disable gnuserv from opening a new frame?

If you set the @code{gnuserv-frame} variable to the frame that should be
used to display buffers that are pulled up, a new frame will not be
created. For example, you could put

@lisp
(setq gnuserv-frame (selected-frame))
@end lisp

early on in your @file{init.el}, to ensure that the first frame created
is the one used for your gnuserv buffers.

There is an option to set the gnuserv target to the current frame.  See
@code{Options->Display->"Other Window" Location->Make Current Frame Gnuserv Target}

You can also change this with Customize.  Select from the
@code{Options} menu @code{Advanced
(Customize)->Emacs->Environment->Gnuserv->Gnuserv Frame...}  or type
@kbd{M-x customize @key{RET} gnuserv @key{RET}}.


@node Q5.5.4, Q5.5.5, Q5.5.3, External Subsystems

Put the following in your @file{init.el} file to start the server:

@lisp
(gnuserv-start)
@end lisp

Start your first XEmacs as usual.  After that, you can do:

@example
gnuclient randomfilename
@end example

from the command line to get your existing XEmacs process to open a new
frame and visit randomfilename in that window. When you're done editing
randomfilename, hit @kbd{C-x #} to kill the buffer and get rid of the
frame.

See also man page of gnuclient.

@unnumberedsubsec Q6.0.1: What are the various packages for reading mail?

#### Write me.

@node Q6.0.2, Q6.0.3, Q6.0.1, Internet
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.0.2: How can I send mail?

Under Unix and Mac OS X, the @samp{sendmail} package is normally used
for this.
#### Write me.

Under Windows, you need to use @samp{smtpmail}, which communicates
directly with the mail server, as there is no @file{sendmail} program
running.  To get it working, use code like the following in your
@file{init.el} file:

@lisp
  ;; Get mail working under Windows.
  (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it) ; for message/Gnus
  (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it) ; for C-x m, etc.
  ;; the following ensures that mail problems can be debugged: it logs a trace
  ;; of the SMTP conversation to *trace of SMTP session to <somewhere>*.
  (setq smtpmail-debug-info t)
  ;; Substitute your info here.
  ;(setq user-mail-address "ben@@xemacs.org")
  ;(setq user-full-name "Ben Wing")
  ;(setq smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.myserver.myisp.com")
  ;; The following two aren't completely necessary but may help.
  ;(setq smtpmail-local-domain "666.com")
  ;(setq smtpmail-sendto-domain "666.com")
  ;; If your SMTP server requires a username/password to authenticate, as
  ;; many do nowadays, set them like this:
  ;(setq smtpmail-auth-credentials  ; or use ~/.authinfo
  ;	'(("smtp.myserver.myisp.com" 25 "USER@@SOMEWHERE" "PASSWORD")))

  ;; Other possibilities for getting smtpmail to work:
  ;;
  ;;  If for some reason you need to authenticate using the STARTTLS protocol
  ;;   (don't look into this unless you know what it is), use
  ;;  (setq smtpmail-starttls-credentials
  ;;      '(("YOUR SMTP HOST" 25 "~/.my_smtp_tls.key" "~/.my_smtp_tls.cert")))
  ;;  Requires external program
  ;;    ftp://ftp.opaopa.org/pub/elisp/starttls-*.tar.gz.
  ;;  See http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt,
  ;;      http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2487.txt
@end lisp

The lines you need to care about are those that set
@code{user-mail-address}, @code{user-full-name},
@code{smtpmail-default-smtp-server}, and
@code{smtpmail-auth-credentials}.  You need to set these with,
respectively, your email address, your full name, the SMTP server you
use for outgoing mail, and the username and password you need to log
in to your SMTP server. (If for some reason your SMTP server doesn't
require logging in to send mail, don't uncomment this last line.)

The other settings may be useful in specific cases, but you should know what
you're doing before enabling them.

@node Q6.0.8, Q6.0.9, Q6.0.7, Internet
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.0.8: An MUA gets an error incorporating new mail.

rmail and VM, and probably other MUA's as well, get new mail from
your mailbox (called @file{/var/mail/$USER} or @file{/var/spool/mail/$USER}
or something similar) using a program called @code{movemail}.
This program interlocks with @code{/bin/mail} using the protocol
defined by @code{/bin/mail}.

There are various different protocols in general use, which you need to
specify using the @samp{--mail-locking} option
(@samp{--with-mail-locking} in 21.5 or later) to @file{configure}:

@table @samp
@item lockf
POSIX file locking with @code{lockf()}
@item flock
BSD file locking with @code{flock()}
@item dot
To manipulate mail file @file{foo}, first create file @file{foo.lock}
@item locking
Use @code{locking()}, Microsoft's renamed @code{flock()}
@item mmdf
Use @code{lk_open()} and @code{lk_close()} as defined by the Multi-channel
Memo Distribution Facility
@item pop
Retrieve mail using POP (the Post Office Protocol).  This is the
default for Cygwin/MinGW.
@end table

@strong{IF YOU DON'T USE THE FORM OF INTERLOCKING THAT IS NORMAL ON YOUR
SYSTEM, YOU CAN LOSE MAIL!}

Usually the value is correctly determined automatically:
@file{configure} tries to detect the method in use, and defaults exist
on systems for which this doesn't work.

However, if you run into problems incorporating new mail, it may be
because an incorrect method is being used.

If your system uses the lock file protocol, and permissions are set
so that ordinary users cannot write lock files in the mail spool
directory, you may need to make @file{movemail} setgid to a
suitable group such as @samp{mail}.  You can use these commands (as
root):

@example
chgrp mail movemail
chmod 2755 movemail
@end example

If you are using the @samp{pop} locking method, @file{movemail} must
be setuid root.

Installation normally copies movemail from the build directory to an
installation directory which is usually under @file{/usr/local/lib}.
The installed copy of @file{movemail} is usually in the directory
@file{/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/TARGET} (for example,
@file{/usr/local/lib/xemacs-21.4.15/i686-pc-cygwin}).  You must change
the group and mode of the installed copy; changing the group and mode
of the build directory copy is ineffective.

@node Q6.0.9, Q6.0.10, Q6.0.8, Internet
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.0.9: Why isn't @file{movemail} working?

@xref{Q6.0.8}.

Note also that older versions of Mozilla came with a @file{movemail}
program that is @strong{not} compatible with XEmacs.  Do not use it.
Always use the @file{movemail} installed with your XEmacs.  Failure to
do so can result in lost mail.

Firstly there is an ftp site which describes X-faces and has the
associated tools mentioned below, at
@uref{http://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/faces/}.

Then the steps are

@enumerate
@item
Create 48x48x1 bitmap with your favorite tool

@item
Convert to "icon" format using one of xbm2ikon, pbmtoicon, etc.,
and then compile the face.

@item
@example
cat file.xbm | xbm2ikon |compface > file.face
@end example

@item
Then be sure to quote things that are necessary for emacs strings:

@example
cat ./file.face | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g'
@iftex
\ @*
@end iftex
| sed 's/\"/\\\"/g' > ./file.face.quoted
@end example

@item
Then set up emacs to include the file as a mail header - there were a
couple of suggestions here---either something like:

@lisp
(setq  mail-default-headers
       "X-Face:  @email{Ugly looking text string here}")
@end lisp

Or, alternatively, as:

@lisp
(defun mail-insert-x-face ()
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (search-forward mail-header-separator)
    (beginning-of-line)
    (insert "X-Face:")
    (insert-file-contents "~/.face")))

(add-hook 'mail-setup-hook 'mail-insert-x-face)
@end lisp
@end enumerate

However, 2 things might be wrong:

Some versions of pbmtoicon produces some header lines that is not
expected by the version of compface that I grabbed. So I found I had to
include a @code{tail +3} in the pipeline like this:

@example
cat file.xbm | xbm2ikon | tail +3 |compface > file.face
@end example

Some people have also found that if one uses the @code{(insert-file)}
method, one should NOT quote the face string using the sed script .

It might also be helpful to use @email{stig@@hackvan.com, Stig's} script
xbm2face (included in the compface distribution at XEmacs.org) to do the
conversion.

@node Q6.3.1, Q6.3.2, Q6.2.2, Internet

Yes.  Of course XEmacs can use any network file system (such as NFS or
Windows file sharing) you have available, and includes some
optimizations and safety features appropriate to those environments.

It is also possible to transparently edit files via FTP, ssh, or rsh.  That
is, XEmacs makes a local copy using the transport in the background, and
automatically refreshes the remote original from that copy when you save
it.  XEmacs also is capable of doing file system manipulations like
creating and removing directories and files.  The FTP interface is
provided by the standard @samp{efs} package @ref{Top, EFS, , efs}.  The
ssh/rsh interface is provided by the optional @samp{tramp} package

@unnumberedsubsec Q7.1.1: What is the difference in key sequences between XEmacs and GNU Emacs?

@email{clerik@@naggum.no, Erik Naggum} writes;

@quotation
Emacs has a legacy of keyboards that produced characters with modifier
bits, and therefore map a variety of input systems into this scheme even
today.  XEmacs is instead optimized for X events.  This causes an
incompatibility in the way key sequences are specified, but both Emacs
and XEmacs will accept a key sequence as a vector of lists of modifiers
that ends with a key, e.g., to bind @kbd{M-C-a}, you would say
@code{[(meta control a)]} in both Emacsen.  XEmacs has an abbreviated
form for a single key, just (meta control a).  Emacs has an abbreviated
form for the Control and the Meta modifiers to string-characters (the
ASCII characters), as in @samp{\M-\C-a}.  XEmacs users need to be aware
that the abbreviated form works only for one-character key sequences,
while Emacs users need to be aware that the string-character is rather
limited.  Specifically, the string-character can accommodate only 256
different values, 128 of which have the Meta modifier and 128 of which
have not.  In each of these blocks, only 32 characters have the Control
modifier.  Whereas @code{[(meta control A)]} differs from @code{[(meta
control a)]} because the case differs, @samp{\M-\C-a} and @samp{\M-\C-A}
do not.  Programmers are advised to use the full common form, both
because it is more readable and less error-prone, and because it is
supported by both Emacsen.
@end quotation

Another (even safer) way to be sure of the key-sequences is to use the
@code{read-kbd-macro} function, which takes a string like @samp{C-c
<up>}, and converts it to the internal key representation of the Emacs
you use.  The function is available both on XEmacs and GNU Emacs.

@unnumberedsubsec Q7.1.2: Can I generate "fake" keyboard events?

I wonder if there is an interactive function that can generate
@dfn{fake} keyboard events.  This way, I could simply map them inside
XEmacs.

This seems to work:

@lisp
(defun cg--generate-char-event (ch)
  "Generate an event, as if ch has been typed"
  (dispatch-event (character-to-event ch)))

;;  Backspace and Delete stuff
(global-set-key [backspace]
  (lambda () (interactive) (cg--generate-char-event 127)))
(global-set-key [unknown_keysym_0x4]
  (lambda () (interactive) (cg--generate-char-event 4)))
@end lisp

@node Q7.1.3, Q7.1.4, Q7.1.2, Advanced
@unnumberedsubsec Q7.1.3: Could you explain @code{read-kbd-macro} in more detail?

The @code{read-kbd-macro} function returns the internal Emacs
representation of a human-readable string (which is its argument).
Thus:

@lisp
(read-kbd-macro "C-c C-a")
@result{} [(control ?c) (control ?a)]

(read-kbd-macro "C-c C-. <up>")
@result{} [(control ?c) (control ?.) up]
@end lisp

In GNU Emacs the same forms will be evaluated to what GNU Emacs
understands internally---the sequences @code{"\C-x\C-c"} and @code{[3
67108910 up]}, respectively.

The exact @dfn{human-readable} syntax is defined in the docstring of
@code{edmacro-mode}.  I'll repeat it here, for completeness.

@quotation
Format of keyboard macros during editing:

Text is divided into @dfn{words} separated by whitespace.  Except for
the words described below, the characters of each word go directly as
characters of the macro.  The whitespace that separates words is
ignored.  Whitespace in the macro must be written explicitly, as in
@kbd{foo @key{SPC} bar @key{RET}}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The special words @kbd{RET}, @kbd{SPC}, @kbd{TAB}, @kbd{DEL}, @kbd{LFD},
@kbd{ESC}, and @kbd{NUL} represent special control characters.  The
words must be written in uppercase.

@item
A word in angle brackets, e.g., @code{<return>}, @code{<down>}, or
@code{<f1>}, represents a function key.  (Note that in the standard
configuration, the function key @code{<return>} and the control key
@key{RET} are synonymous.)  You can use angle brackets on the words
@key{RET}, @key{SPC}, etc., but they are not required there.

@item
Keys can be written by their @sc{ascii} code, using a backslash followed
by up to six octal digits.  This is the only way to represent keys with
codes above \377.

@item
One or more prefixes @kbd{M-} (meta), @kbd{C-} (control), @kbd{S-}
(shift), @kbd{A-} (alt), @kbd{H-} (hyper), and @kbd{s-} (super) may
precede a character or key notation.  For function keys, the prefixes
may go inside or outside of the brackets: @code{C-<down>} @equiv{}
@code{<C-down>}.  The prefixes may be written in any order: @kbd{M-C-x}
@equiv{} @kbd{C-M-x}.

Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., @kbd{C-abc}, except
that the Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and optional
minus sign: @kbd{M--123} @equiv{} @kbd{M-- M-1 M-2 M-3}.

@item
The @code{^} notation for control characters also works: @kbd{^M}
@equiv{} @kbd{C-m}.

@item
Double angle brackets enclose command names: @code{<<next-line>>} is
shorthand for @kbd{M-x next-line @key{RET}}.

@item
Finally, @code{REM} or @code{;;} causes the rest of the line to be
ignored as a comment.
@end itemize

Any word may be prefixed by a multiplier in the form of a decimal number
and @code{*}: @code{3*<right>} @equiv{} @code{<right> <right> <right>},
and @code{10*foo} @equiv{}
@iftex
@*
@end iftex
@code{foofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoo}.

Multiple text keys can normally be strung together to form a word, but
you may need to add whitespace if the word would look like one of the
above notations: @code{; ; ;} is a keyboard macro with three semicolons,
but @code{;;;} is a comment.  Likewise, @code{\ 1 2 3} is four keys but
@code{\123} is a single key written in octal, and @code{< right >} is
seven keys but @code{<right>} is a single function key.  When in doubt,
use whitespace.

@unnumberedsubsec Q7.1.4: What is the performance hit of @code{let}?

In most cases, not noticeable.  Besides, there's no avoiding
@code{let}---you have to bind your local variables, after all.  Some
pose a question whether to nest @code{let}s, or use one @code{let} per
function.  I think because of clarity and maintenance (and possible
future implementation), @code{let}-s should be used (nested) in a way to
provide the clearest code.

@node Q7.1.5, Q7.1.6, Q7.1.4, Advanced
@unnumberedsubsec Q7.1.5: What is the recommended use of @code{setq}?

@itemize @bullet
@item Global variables

You will typically @code{defvar} your global variable to a default
value, and use @code{setq} to set it later.

It is never a good practice to @code{setq} user variables (like
@code{case-fold-search}, etc.), as it ignores the user's choice
unconditionally.  Note that @code{defvar} doesn't change the value of a
variable if it was bound previously.  If you wish to change a
user-variable temporarily, use @code{let}:

@lisp
(let ((case-fold-search nil))
  ...                                   ; code with searches that must be case-sensitive
  ...)
@end lisp

You will notice the user-variables by their docstrings beginning with an
asterisk (a convention).

@item Local variables

Bind them with @code{let}, which will unbind them (or restore their
previous value, if they were bound) after exiting from the @code{let}
form.  Change the value of local variables with @code{setq} or whatever
you like (e.g. @code{incf}, @code{setf} and such).  The @code{let} form
can even return one of its local variables.

Typical usage:

@lisp
;; iterate through the elements of the list returned by
;; `hairy-function-that-returns-list'
(let ((l (hairy-function-that-returns-list)))
  (while l
    ... do something with (car l) ...
    (setq l (cdr l))))
@end lisp

Another typical usage includes building a value simply to work with it.

@lisp
;; Build the mode keymap out of the key-translation-alist
(let ((inbox (file-truename (expand-file-name box)))
      (i 0))
  ... code dealing with inbox ...
  inbox)
@end lisp

This piece of code uses the local variable @code{inbox}, which becomes
unbound (or regains old value) after exiting the form.  The form also
returns the value of @code{inbox}, which can be reused, for instance:

@lisp
(setq foo-processed-inbox
      (let .....))
@end lisp
@end itemize

@node Q7.1.6, Q7.1.7, Q7.1.5, Advanced
@unnumberedsubsec Q7.1.6: What is the typical misuse of @code{setq}?

A typical misuse is probably @code{setq}ing a variable that was meant to
be local.  Such a variable will remain bound forever, never to be
garbage-collected.  For example, the code doing:

@lisp
(defun my-function (whatever)
  (setq a nil)
  ... build a large list ...
  ... and exit ...)
@end lisp

does a bad thing, as @code{a} will keep consuming memory, never to be
unbound.  The correct thing is to do it like this:

@lisp
(defun my-function (whatever)
  (let (a)                              ; default initialization is to nil
    ... build a large list ...
    ... and exit, unbinding `a' in the process  ...)
@end lisp

Not only is this prettier syntactically, but it makes it possible for
Emacs to garbage-collect the objects which @code{a} used to reference.

Note that even global variables should not be @code{setq}ed without
@code{defvar}ing them first, because the byte-compiler issues warnings.
The reason for the warning is the following:

@lisp
(defun flurgoze nil)                    ; ok, global internal variable
...

(setq flurghoze t)                      ; ops!  a typo, but semantically correct.
                                        ; however, the byte-compiler warns.

While compiling toplevel forms:

@node Q7.1.7, Q7.1.8, Q7.1.6, Advanced
@unnumberedsubsec Q7.1.7: I like the @code{do} form of cl, does it slow things down?

It shouldn't.  Here is what Dave Gillespie has to say about cl.el
performance:

@quotation
Many of the advanced features of this package, such as @code{defun*},
@code{loop}, and @code{setf}, are implemented as Lisp macros.  In
byte-compiled code, these complex notations will be expanded into
equivalent Lisp code which is simple and efficient.  For example, the
forms

@lisp
(incf i n)
(push x (car p))
@end lisp

are expanded at compile-time to the Lisp forms

@lisp
(setq i (+ i n))
(setcar p (cons x (car p)))
@end lisp

which are the most efficient ways of doing these respective operations
in Lisp.  Thus, there is no performance penalty for using the more
readable @code{incf} and @code{push} forms in your compiled code.

@emph{Interpreted} code, on the other hand, must expand these macros
every time they are executed.  For this reason it is strongly
recommended that code making heavy use of macros be compiled.  (The
features labelled @dfn{Special Form} instead of @dfn{Function} in this
manual are macros.)  A loop using @code{incf} a hundred times will
execute considerably faster if compiled, and will also garbage-collect
less because the macro expansion will not have to be generated, used,
and thrown away a hundred times.

You can find out how a macro expands by using the @code{cl-prettyexpand}
function.

@unnumberedsubsec Q7.1.8: I like recursion, does it slow things down?

Yes.  The Emacs byte-compiler cannot do much to optimize recursion.  But
think well whether this is a real concern in Emacs.  Much of the Emacs
slowness comes from internal mechanisms such as redisplay, or from the
fact that it is an interpreter.

Please try not to make your code much uglier to gain a very small speed
gain.  It's not usually worth it.

@unnumberedsubsec Q7.1.9: How do I put a glyph as annotation in a buffer?

Here is a solution that will insert the glyph annotation at the

(make-annotation (make-glyph '([FORMAT :file FILE]
                               [string :data "fallback-text"]))

                 'text
                 (current-buffer))
@end lisp

Replace @samp{FORMAT} with an unquoted symbol representing the format of
the image (e.g. @code{xpm}, @code{xbm}, @code{gif}, @code{jpeg}, etc.)
Instead of @samp{FILE}, use the image file name
(e.g.
@iftex
@*
@end iftex
@file{/usr/local/lib/xemacs-21.4/etc/recycle.xpm}).

You can turn this to a function (that optionally prompts you for a file
name), and inserts the glyph at @code{(point)} instead of
@code{(point-min)}.

I tried to use @code{map-extents} to do an operation on all the extents

of extents.  Is it buggy?

No.  The documentation of @code{map-extents} states that it will iterate
across the extents as long as @var{function} returns @code{nil}.
Unexperienced programmers often forget to return @code{nil} explicitly,
which results in buggy code.  For instance, the following code is
supposed to delete all the extents in a buffer, and issue as many
@samp{fubar!} messages.

@lisp

Instead, it will delete only the first extent, and stop right there --
because @code{message} will return a non-nil value.  The correct code
is:

@unnumberedsubsec Q7.2.1: What are bignums, ratios, and bigfloats in Lisp?

Thanks to @email{james@@xemacs.org, Jerry James}, XEmacs 21.5.18 and
later can use the capabilities of multiple-precision libraries that may
be available for your platform.  The GNU Multiple Precision (GMP) and
BSD Multiple Precision (MP) libraries are partially supported.  GMP
gives you @dfn{bignums} (arbitrary precision integers), @dfn{ratios}
(arbitrary precision fractions), and @dfn{bigfloats} (arbitrary
precision floating point numbers).  GNU MP is better-supported by XEmacs
at the time of writing (2004-04-06).  BSD MP support does not include
ratios or bigfloats, and it throws errors that aren't understood.

In most cases, bignum support should be transparent to users and Lisp
programmers.  A bignum-enabled XEmacs will automatically convert from
fixnums to bignums and back in pure integer arithmetic, and for GNU MP,
from floats to bigfloats.  (Bigfloats must be explicitly coerced to
other types, even if they are exactly representable by less precise
types.)  The Lisp reader and printer have been enhanced to handle
bignums, as have the mathematical functions.  Rationals (fixnums,
bignums, and ratios) are printed using the @samp{%d}, @samp{%o},
@samp{%x}, and @samp{%u} format conversions.  The read syntax for ratios
is @samp{3/5}.

User-visible changes in behavior include (in probable order of annoyance)

@itemize
@item
Arithmetic can cause a segfault, depending on your MP library
@ref{Q7.2.2, XEmacs segfaults when I use very big numbers!}.

@item
Terminology is not Common-Lisp-conforming.  For example, ``integer'' for
Emacs Lisp means what Common Lisp calls ``fixnum''.  This issue is being
investigated, but the use of ``integer'' for fixnum is pervasive and may
cause backward-compatibility and GNU-Emacs-compatibility problems.

@item
Many operations that used to cause a range error now succeed, with
intermediate results and return values coerced to bignums as needed.

@item
An atom with ratio read syntax now returns a number, not a symbol.

@item
The @samp{%u} format conversion will now give an error if its argument
is negative.  (Without MP, it prints a number which Lisp can't read.)
@end itemize

@emph{Surgeon General's Warning}: The automatic conversions cannot be
disabled at runtime.  New functions have been added which produce
ratios, so there should be few surprises with type conflicts, but they
can't be ruled out.  ``Arbitrary'' precision means precisely what it
says.  If you work with extremely large numbers, your machine may
arbitrarily decide to hand you an unpleasant surprise rather than a
bignum @ref{Q7.2.2, XEmacs segfaults when I use very big numbers!}.

To configure with GNU MP, add @samp{--use-number-lib=gmp}
(@samp{--enable-bignum=gmp} in 21.5 or later) to your invocation of
@file{configure}.  For BSD MP, use @samp{--use-number-lib=mp}
(@samp{--enable-bignum=mp} for 21.5).

If you would like to help with bignum support, especially on BSD MP,
please subscribe to the @uref{http://www.xemacs.org/Lists/#xemacs-beta,

GMP by default allocates temporaries on the stack.  If you run out of
stack space, you're dead; there is no way that we know of to reliably
detect this condition, because @samp{alloca} is typically implemented to
be @emph{fast} rather than robust.  If you just need a little more
oomph, use a bigger stack (@emph{e.g.}, the @file{ulimit -s} command in
bash(1)).  If you want robustness at the cost of speed, configure GMP

Yeah, yeah, it has always worked for integer types, because fixnums and

arbitrary precision obviously requires consing new objects because the

@unnumberedsubsec Q8.0.2: What is AUCTeX?  Where do you get it?

AUCTeX is a complex and sophisticated editing package dedicated to TeX
and related text formatting languages, including LaTeX and Texinfo.
It provides support for running TeX on a file or part of a file,
include files, and of course shortcuts for entering common TeX macros,
LaTeX environments, etc, and for fontlock.

AUCTeX is a standard package provided by XEmacs.  You can get it as
usual through the @kbd{M-x list-packages} interface.  It is also
included in the (non-Mule) SUMO package.  The AUCTeX XEmacs package is
maintained by Uwe Brauer <GET MAIL ADDRESS>.

AUCTeX is extremely complicated, and its developers primarily 
use GNU Emacs.  Not all features of the bleeding edge version 
of AUCTeX are immediately ported to XEmacs; if you need 
these, you may be better off getting the most recent versions 
from the GNU AUCTeX project on @uref{http://savannah.gnu.org}.

AUCTeX works fine on both stock Emacs and XEmacs has been doing so for

Most problems with AUCTeX are one of two things:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The TeX-lisp-directory in @file{tex-site.el} and the makefile don't

With AUCTeX, fast typing is hard because the current chapter, section

@unnumberedsubsec Q8.1.1: Is there a reason for an Emacs package not to be included in XEmacs?

The reason for an Emacs package not to be included in XEmacs is
usually one or more of the following:

@enumerate
@item
The package has not been ported to XEmacs.  This will typically happen
when it uses GNU-Emacs-specific features, which make it fail under
XEmacs.

Porting a package to XEmacs can range from a trivial amount of change to
a partial or full rewrite.  Fortunately, the authors of modern packages
usually choose to support both Emacsen themselves.

@item
The package has been decided not to be appropriate for XEmacs.  It may
have an equivalent or better replacement within XEmacs, in which case
the developers may choose not to burden themselves with supporting an
additional package.

Each package bundled with XEmacs means more work for the maintainers,
whether they want it or not.  If you are ready to take over the
maintenance responsibilities for the package you port, be sure to say
so---we will more likely include it.

@item
The package simply hasn't been noted by the XEmacs development.  If
that's the case, the messages like yours are very useful for attracting
our attention.

@item
The package was noted by the developers, but they simply haven't yet
gotten around to including/porting it.  Wait for the next release or,
even better, offer your help.  It will be gladly accepted and
appreciated.

@unnumberedsubsec Q8.2.1: What are SPARCworks, EOS, and WorkShop?

SPARCworks was a development environment from Sun (circa 1993-1996)
and consisted of compilers (C, C++, FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90, Ada, and
Pascal), a debugger, and other tools such as TeamWare (for
configuration management), MakeTool, etc.

EOS is the integration of XEmacs with the SPARCworks debugger.  It
allows one to use an XEmacs frame to view code (complete with
fontification, etc.), set breakpoints, print variables, etc., while
using the SPARCworks debugger.

EOS stands for "Era on SPARCworks"; Era stood for "Emacs Rewritten
Again" and was the name used by Sun for its modified version of Lucid
Emacs (later XEmacs) in the early-mid 90's.  This is documented in
more detail in the history section of the XEmacs About page.

EOS was replaced around 1996 with a newer graphical development
environment called Sun WorkShop.  The current status of this is
unknown.

@unnumberedsubsec Q8.2.3: What is/was Energize?

The "Energize Programming System" was a C and C++ development environment
sold by Lucid, Inc.  It was the reason why Lucid Emacs, now XEmacs, was
created in the first place.  Unfortunately, Lucid went out of business in
1994.  The rights to sell it in Japan were purchased by INS
Engineering (which briefly employed Stig Hackvan aka Jonathan
Stigelman to work on Japanese support for XEmacs, in late 1994 and
early 1995) and Tartan bought the rights to sell it in the rest of the
world.  However, INS is not selling Energize at this point and may or
may not have ever done so; Tartan certainly never did.

@unnumberedsubsec Q8.2.4: What is Infodock?

@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/infodock/, InfoDock} is an
integrated productivity toolset, mainly aimed at technical people,
hosted at SourceForge.

InfoDock is built atop the XEmacs variant of GNU Emacs and so has all of
the power of Emacs, but with an easier to use and more comprehensive
menu-based user interface.  The bottom portion of this text describes
how it differs from XEmacs and GNU Emacs from the Free Software
Foundation.

InfoDock is aimed at people who want a free, turn-key productivity
environment.  Although InfoDock is customizable, it is not intended for
people who like basic versions of Emacs which need to be customized
extensively for local use; standard Emacs distributions are better for
such uses.  InfoDock is for those people who want a complete,
pre-customized environment in one package, which they need not touch
more than once or twice a year to update to new revisions.

InfoDock is pre-built for SPARC SunOS/Solaris systems, PA-RISC HP-UX,
and Intel Linux systems.  It is intended for use on a color display,
although most features will work on monochrome monitors.  Simply unpack
InfoDock according to the instructions in the ID-INSTALL file and you
are ready to run.

The InfoDock Manual is concise, yet sufficient as a user guide for users
who have never used an Emacs-type editor before.  For users who are
already familiar with Emacs, it supplements the information in the GNU
Emacs Manual.

InfoDock menus are much more extensive and more mature than standard
Emacs menus.  Each menu offers a @samp{Manual} item which displays
documentation associated with the menu's functions.

@noindent
Four types of menubars are provided:
@enumerate
@item
An extensive menubar providing access to global InfoDock commands.
@item
Mode-specific menubars tailored to the current major mode.
@item
A simple menubar for basic editing to help novices get started with InfoDock.
@item
The standard XEmacs menubar.
@end enumerate

Most modes also include mode-specific popup menus.  Additionally, region and
rectangle popup menus are included.

@samp{Hyperbole}, the everyday information manager, is a core part of
InfoDock.  This provides context-sensitive mouse keys, a rolodex-type
contact manager, programmable hypertext buttons, and an autonumbered
outliner with embedded hyperlink anchors.

The @samp{OO-Browser}, a multi-language object-oriented code browser, is a
standard part of InfoDock.

InfoDock saves a more extensive set of user options than other Emacs
versions.

InfoDock inserts a useful file header in many file types, showing the
author, summary, and last modification time of each file.  A summary
program can then be used to summarize all of the files in a directory,
for easy MANIFEST file creation.

Your working set of buffers is automatically saved and restored (if you
answer yes to a prompt) between InfoDock sessions.

Refined color choices for code highlighting are provided for both dark and
light background display frames.

The @kbd{C-z} key prefix performs frame-based commands which parallel the
@kbd{C-x} key prefix for window-based commands.

The Smart Menu system is included for producing command menus on dumb
terminals.

Lisp libraries are better categorized according to function.

Extensions and improvements to many areas of Emacs are included, such as:
paragraph filling, mail reading with Rmail, shell handling, outlining, code
highlighting and browsing, and man page browsing.

@unnumberedsubsec Q9.0.2: What's new in XEmacs 21.4?

21.4 was the "stable" version of the 21.2 series, which was considered
"experimental" throughout its life; thus there were no "official"
releases at all.  In essence, XEmacs is now following the "alternating"
scheme of Linux, where at any point there are at least two different
development branches, one "stable" and one "experimental".  Periodic
releases happen in both branches, but those in the experimental branch
are not tested as well, and there's no guarantee they will work at all.
The experiemental branch is open to any and all code that's acceptable
to the developers; the stable branch, however, is in general limited
only to bug fixes, and all contributions are carefully reviewed to make
sure they will increase and not decrease stability.

21.3 never existed at all; it was decided to follow the Linux scheme
exactly, where odd-numbered series are experimental and even-numbered
ones stable.

The following lists summarizes the essential changes made in this
version.  For a fuller list, see the @file{NEWS} in the @file{etc}
directory of the XEmacs distribution, or use @kbd{C-h n} or the
@samp{Help} menu to view this file inside of XEmacs.

@unnumberedsubsec Q9.0.5: What's new in XEmacs 20.3?

XEmacs 20.3 was released in November 1997. It contains many bugfixes,
and a number of new features, including Autoconf 2 based configuration,
additional support for Mule (Multi-language extensions to Emacs), many
more customizations, multiple frames on TTY-s, support for multiple info
directories, an enhanced gnuclient, improvements to regexp matching,
increased MIME support, and many, many synches with GNU Emacs 20.

The XEmacs/Mule support has been only seriously tested in a Japanese
locale, and no doubt many problems still remain.  The support for
ISO-Latin-1 and Japanese is fairly strong.  MULE support comes at a
price---about a 30% slowdown from 19.16.  We're making progress on
improving performance and XEmacs 20.3 compiled without Mule (which is
the default) is definitely faster than XEmacs 19.16.

XEmacs 20.3 is the first non-beta v20 release, and will be the
basis for all further development.

bugs from 20.0 have been fixed for this release.  20.2 also contains a
new system for customizing XEmacs options, invoked via @kbd{M-x
customize}.

XEmacs 20.2 is the development release (20.0 was beta), and is no longer
considered unstable.

@unnumbered 10 New information about old XEmacsen

This is part 10 of the XEmacs Frequently Asked Questions list.  It will
occasionally be updated to reflect new information about versions which
are no longer being revised by the XEmacs Project.  The primary purpose
is advice on compatibility of older XEmacsen with new packages and
updated versions of packages, but bug fixes (which will not be applied
to released XEmacsen, but users can apply themselves) are also accepted.

After a bit of sleuthing, I discovered the essence of the problem.
For me, the form:

@lisp
    	(with-temp-buffer
    	  (insert-file-contents "foo.xpm")
    	  (buffer-string))
@end lisp

returns the empty string.  This is because something somewhere
replaces the XPM data with a glyph --- I haven't figured out where
this occurs.

Do this:

@lisp
    (setq format-alist nil)
@end lisp

The image-mode stuff is gone from format-alist in the 21.4
branch, praise be.

@unnumberedsubsec Q10.0.2: XEmacs won't start on Windows in XEmacs 21.1.

XEmacs relies on a process called "dumping" to generate a working
executable. Under MS-Windows this process effectively fixes the memory
addresses of information in the executable. When XEmacs starts up it tries
to reserve these memory addresses so that the dumping process can be
reversed -- putting the information back at the correct addresses.
Unfortunately some .DLLs (for instance the soundblaster driver) occupy
memory addresses that can conflict with those needed by the dumped XEmacs
executable. In this instance XEmacs will fail to start without any
explanation. Note that this is extremely machine specific.

21.1.10 includes a fix for this that makes more intelligent guesses
about which memory addresses will be free, and this should cure the
problem for most people.  21.4 implements "portable dumping", which
eliminates the problem altogether.  We recommend you use the 21.4
binaries, but you can use the 21.1 binaries if you are very paranoid
about stability.  @xref{Q1.1.2, Are binaries available?}.
