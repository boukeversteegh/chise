This directory contains the source for the setup program for the XEmacs
net releases.

For commentary on how to do a release please see `package-net.el'

This code has been adapted from the cygwin net release installer. In
particular note that the cygwin net release installer is actively
maintained and therefore we will want to incorporate improvements from
that. I have therefore tried to use the cygwin way wherever
possible. I have however cleaned up the code somewhat so that there
are not billions of warnings.

This program should get built as part of the standard XEmacs
make. Note however that if you use trhe cygwin build you will need a
NON CYGWIN VERSION OF ZLIB.
