The theme of the gamma series of 21.4 releases is "oxymoron", that is,
contradiction in terms.  Each patchlevel will be assigned a unique
codename from the list below.  The rationale for the first should be
obvious.

The second and third are my tributes to Richard Stallman and the early
developers of Lucid Emacs/XEmacs (primarily Jamie Zawinski, but it
also fits Ben Wing which is appropriate to the Mule theme), in
chronological order.  I cannot list all the debts this release owes
for individual contributions, but I must credit the fundamental
excellence of the design of [X]Emacs for inspiring the audacious
proposal to add both GTK and Windows/MULE to XEmacs over a period of
two months, and for the success of the GTK merge.  Without the
prospect of such a big win, I could not have justified trying to
coordinate a release myself.
