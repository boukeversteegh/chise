To use:

You need to build and install the XEmacs distribution.  Also you need
the xemacs packages in both source and installed versions.

Edit "dirs.py" to reflect the locations of the above components.

Edit "version.py" to reflect the current version, as well as the
welcome message.

Run 
	python pre_wise.py > xemacs-XXX.wse

	(for XXX use a version or date code of your choosing)

Run 
	cmd /c xemacs-XXX.wse 

to produce xemacs-XXX.exe


"pre_wise.py" is a preprocessor for the Wise installer maker.  It
reads "xemacs.tmpl" which is a Wise input file, except that certain
portions are enclosed in triple angle brackets <<<like this>>>

These portions are evaluated as Python expressions and replaced by the 
string representations of the resulting value.  This allows for
things to change from release to release without having to re-do the
Wise installation each time.  Also it keeps you from having to
manually drag-n-drop all the package files, which is rather tedious!
